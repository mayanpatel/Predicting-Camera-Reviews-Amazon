## Data Science Capstone Project: Predicting Amazon Camera reviews

This project was completed during the General Assembly Data Science Immersive course in London.

### Introduction and goals:
Amazon is the worlds largest online marketplace. With e-commerce booming and more and more products sold online, this has been met with an increase in the quantity and influence of product reviews. I am interested in camera reviews being a photographer but also as a consumer where reviews drive my purchase decisions, and finally as a marketeer to study what consumers care about and use that information to create better products and identify unmet needs.

- The aim of this project is to use the Amazon review dataset to correctly predict the star rating on camera reviews.
- A secondary objective is to identify camera features that lead to good or bad experiences through popular terms mentioned in reviews.

Each row in my dataset is a review from the Amazon.com review dataset taken from a collection of reviews during the period 1995 - 2015.

The model is designed to be of interest to product developers and marketeers seeking understanding of the digital camera market through reviewer behaviour and identification of unmet needs.

The analysis was performed both to predict on a scale of 1-5 star and as a binary classification problem.
