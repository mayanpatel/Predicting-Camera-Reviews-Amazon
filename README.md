## Data Science Capstone Project: Predicting Amazon Camera reviews

This project was completed during the General Assembly Data Science Immersive course in London.

### Introduction and Aims:
Amazon is the worlds largest online marketplace. Along with the growth of the  the platform and and e-commerce in general, comes with it the quantity and culture of product reviews. I am interested in camera reviews being a photographer but also as a consumer using reviews increasingly to drive purchase decisions.  

- The aim of this project is to use the Amazon review dataset to correctly predict the star rating on camera reviews.
- A secondary objective is to identify camera features that lead to good or bad experiences through popular words mentioned in reviews.

Each row in my data is a review from the Amazon.com review dataset taken from a collection of reviews during the period 1995 - 2015.

The model is designed to be of interest to product developers and marketeers seeking understanding of the digital camera market through reviewer behaviour and identification of unmet needs.

The analysis was performed both to predict on a scale of 1-5 star and as a binary classification problem.
