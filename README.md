## Capstone Project: Amazon camera review predictor

This project was completed during the final month of the General Assembly Data Science Immersive course in London.

I am a keen photographer and I wanted to gain insight into the nature of online reviews due to their influence in the purchase decision process. Reviews reveal context to how a product is used and how successfully it meets user needs. Reviews also reveal market insight into which features are divisive in opinion and if there are opportunities when bringing a new product to market. 

The goal was to predict the star rating for a product based on the review text. I used Natural Language Processing techniques, and entiment analysis to feed into my classification models. This was performed as a 1-5 star and also a binary classification problem.
