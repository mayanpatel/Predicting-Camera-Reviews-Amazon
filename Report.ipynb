    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon is the worlds largest online marketplace, surpassing Walmart in market value and briefly attaining a $1 Trillion valuation in July 2019. The growth of Amazon has mirrored a global trend in the last decade of increasing online purchase activity and spend from consumers worldwide. In this changing landscape, ever more important have become the role of product reviews to inform purchase decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviews provide prospective customers with real-world usage experiences and serve to validate marketing claims to judge fit for use. In an ideal world they would provide an unbiased opinion without brand affiliation. Longer term usage reports can also attest to durability while media launch reviews often focus on specifications with short turnarounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of review ratings are striking when observing the consumer buying process online. It is common to filter out low rated products. Algorithms also favour highly ranked products for search impressions and in reccomendation engines. This unfortunately raises the incentive to game the system and buy fake reviews. A large enough problem that Amazon actually does allow sellers to buy reviews from trusted reviewers legally using their Vine programme. Providing those first few initial reviews to get a product off the ground. \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes understanding reviewer behaviour important for any brand. When aggregating insights over thousands of reviews the seller can gain a macro level understanding of the repsonse to their product. This in turn can inform marketing communications and the product development pipeline. For digital cameras this can be more immediate - there is even an opportunity to resolve issues or add competetive features in product functionality through firmware updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use case for analysing reviews is to perform competitor research on a competing product or across the whole digital camera market to identify unfulfilled needs from consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"audience\"> </a>\n",
    "### Audience \n",
    "\n",
    "Product developers and marketeers seeking understanding of the digital camera market through reviewer behaviour and identifcation of unmet needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"objectives\"> </a>\n",
    "### Objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to use the Amazon review dataset to predict the star rating on camera reviews. NLP will be performed on the review text before using a machine learning classifier to \"learn\" the difference between positive and negative reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will be done both on a review scale of 1-5 and also a high/low binary classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "A secondary objective is to identify camera features that lead to good or bad experiences through popular words mentioned in reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictive features used are:\n",
    "- Helpful ratio (helpful votes / total votes on the review)\n",
    "- Verified purchase (Y/N)\n",
    "- Review body (text)\n",
    "- Review length \n",
    "- Camera brand\n",
    "- VADER sentiment scores (performed on the review body text)\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"success\"> </a>\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model accuracy above baseline score\n",
    "- Model comparison across Precision/Recall/F1 scores \n",
    "- Confusion Matrix analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"findings\"> </a>\n",
    "### Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Features that gather high reviews - low light, image quality, full frame, auto focus and high iso.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Problems to resolve in negative reviews- memory card, customer service, camera body, image quality, high iso.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The best performing binary classification model was a Logistic regression algorithm using  Tomeklinks resampling technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "|      |  pred Low  |\tpred High  | \n",
    "|------|------|-----|    \n",
    "|True Low|\t77|   29 |  \n",
    "|True High|\t25|   1081 |  \n",
    "\n",
    "4)  Misclassified reviews were often due to experiences that are mixed, or that change over time. Sometimes even a camera could be satisfactory but another element of the buying experience was not. Adding additional context specific keywords into our model may improve it. E.g hot pixels is a problem or \"noise\" in an image. \n"

    "['Does the 7D beat full frame cameras?']\n",
    "[\"No, but it's so good that one starts to contemplate this question, which was never the case before the 7D was introduced. Both systems, crop and full frame, have their pros and cons and place in photography. But before I get into that let me say I have not been as excited about a camera since the introduction of the 5D MK I four years ago. That's because the 7D raises the crop camera bar to the point where crop users will not feel at a disadvantage to full frame camera users, especially if coupled with awesome ef-s lenses such as the 17-55 f2.8.<br /><br />How so? The 7D sets a new standard in four major ways.<br /><br />1. It produces whopping 18MP pictures, which are just 3MP shy of the current top of the line full frame Canon cameras. Just few years ago most pros were producing stellar results using the 1Ds MKII 16MP camera. Now you have more MPs in a crop sensor, that's a major achievement. This achievement translates into bigger prints and, perhaps more importantly, cropping power. Out shooting wildlife with a 300mm instead of 400mm? You can crop the 7D files down to 50% of their original file size and still obtain sharp pictures. It's just not that easy with the 1D MK III 10MP files.<br /><br />2. Many worried that extra MPs in small crop sensors would translate into nosier pictures, but the amazing thing is that this camera produces images with what seems to be less noise than the 1Ds MKII. The noise level is very good. At ISO 1600 I still prefer pictures coming from my 5D MKII, but below ISO1600 they are very close. Frankly, I can go with either camera because most of my professionally shot portraits and product pictures are shot at ISO100. At ISO100 both produce very clean files and are practically indistinguishable.<br /><br />3. Focus is the one area that was lacking on the previous 1.6 crop Canon cameras and this camera changes that. It's not a 1D in focus speed and accuracy, but it's the next best thing compared to them. It's faster than the Canon 5D MKII, which is known to be slightly faster or around the focus performance range of the 50D and 40D.<br /><br />4. The drive chain is fast, so fast it's beyond anything I needed in my professional work in portrait, commercial, and product photography. Going through pictures taken at 8fps produces very little difference from frame to frame. One probably has to shoot a very fast moving subject/object to see the advantage of such fast drive system.<br /><br />There are obviously many other things that I have not covered in this review. But based on the above, all I can say is that this camera has really raised the bar for all cameras and made it much more affordable to obtain a professional level camera for all types of photography. If you were considering buying the 5D MKII as an upgrade give this camera a test because it might be all you need.<br /><br />As for the advantages of crop cameras I always find it odd that casual users who shoot many things but focus on landscape think they need a full frame to realize their potential. Crop cameras such as the 7D and 50D are fine for most users and offer many advantages including:<br /><br />1. greater depth of field at lower aperture for landscape photography<br /><br />2. greater tilt and shift effect because of sensor size relative to effect (8mm in shift is greater in effect relative to a 22mm sensor compared to a 35mm sensor)<br /><br />3. greater magnification with micro lenses and extension tubes because of smaller sensor (1:1 in full frame equals 35mm, 1:1 in crop equals 22mm)<br /><br />4. smaller lighter lenses with wider aperture that achieve greater reach (such as the 17-55 2.8 vs the 24-70 2.8 similar reach but much lighter and smaller)<br /><br />Traditionally the three areas full frame cameras outshine crop cameras are a bigger brighter viewfinder, shallower depth of field for portrait photography, and better ISO performance, which on the last point the 7D has proven not be an issue anymore.<br />And for the second point really, most beautiful low depth of field portraits are done around f2.8-2.0 in full frame (going wider will make depth of field too narrow to place two eyes in focus). Hence, if one is using a wide prime, a crop sensor will produce the same depth of field at 2.0-1.4. Considering an affordable 50mm f1.4 lens on crop has the same field of view as 85mm lens on full frame there is really no reason to discount a crop camera any more as the 7D levels the playing field.-2.0 in full frame (going wider will make depth of field too narrow to place two eyes in focus). Hence, if one is using a wide prime, a crop sensor will produce the same depth of field at 2.0-1.4. Considering an affordable 50mm f1.4 lens on crop has the same field of view as 85mm lens on full frame there is really no reason to discount a crop camera any more as the 7D levels the playing field.\"]"

    "- The Confusion Matrix for the models below make it more evident why accuracy is not the most explanatory metric if we want to predict all classes.\n",
    "    - Multinomial Naive Bayes and Gradient Boosting classifiers largely predicted 5 stars every time. Predicting the majority class with the 5 star review imbalance in the data is likely to optimise for accuracy but not predict 1,2,3,4 star rated reviews well.\n",
    "    - Random Forest and KNN increased predictions of the lower classes in comparison. Across all models there were very few 2 star classifications.\n",
    "    - Finally Logistic Regression and SVC had a wider spread of predictions across classes and predicted 1 star reviews with much larger frequency. With more errors due to predicting away from the majority class this also meant greater correct predicitons of the minority classes. This is why the F1 score going ahead will be my main metric of comparison.\n",

    "- Initial findings show that predicting multi classification pose difficulties.  \n",

I shot a few family weddings, and many newborn pictures, and was extremely satisfied with the 40D.  I used this camera for about 2 years before I got the dreaded Error 99, and decided it was no longer reliable for events.  So I purchased the 7D, (I kept the 40D as a backup camera, since the Error 99 does not appear every time I use it), and the 7D was so much more difficult to use.  The auto focus seemed inaccurate.  I tried to convince myself it was the lens, but after using the same lens on the 40D with excellent results, I suspected there was an issue with the 7D.  My editing program of choice is Lightroom, and I also hated the fact that Lightroom seemed to have an issue with processing bright red.  Everything red would appear hot pink.  It also seemed to have a banding or artifact problem, as everyone wearing black would have lines through their clothing that needed extensive editing.  This is not fun when photographing a wedding and the groom is wearing a black tux.  I had read reviews about overall softness, and I felt this was a problem for me as well.  If I was photographing a large group, I would get nervous and take several of the same photo, as I had so many problems with focus and lack of detail in group shots. After 18 months, I finally decided to sell this camera to a store that buys used camera gear (and lost more money than I care to think about), as it was just not for me.  I prefer to spend more time taking pictures, and enhancing the images I have taken, instead of correcting them.  I have since purchased a Canon full frame, and am amazed with the image quality and sharpness over the 7D, and the only thing disappointing is that I did not get rid of it sooner.'],\n",

       "        \"I've tried to like this camera but after 2 weeks of usage, I've reset any expectation of achieving that.<br /><br />For all the chest beating about this camera being designed for video, it's crippled by poor ergonomics. The IQ is excellent but so are other cameras in this category so in that sense I'll call the IQ excellent.  IMHO, the design smacks of decisions made by people that don't know video. Case in point is you can't monitor audio with headphones (mandatory for anyone who knows) when the LCD is open (also mandatory for anyone who knows cameras on tripods are not at 90 degrees to eye height).<br /><br />Worse is the inability (as of this writing) to keep the data display on for more than 10 seconds (independent of recording or not). I've read a Panasonic marketing manager said it's to prevent burn in. It's my screen, if I want to burn it out to get the recording I require, it's mine to do. I should have the option. Panasonic picked a screen that burns in and is not fit for purpose, not me.<br /><br />Third is there is no Tally light (indication that the camera is recording) if you close the screen to save battery. None. Zero. Zip. The recording can fill up the card and you are none the wiser.<br /><br />Then there's the inability to stop recording over wifi,  no focus peaking, no zebras ... unbelievable.<br /><br />It's a joke of a camera for noob filmaker wannabes.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Another problem with the design of the GH3 that I encountered as have others is the inconsistent record button.  What should be a great feature for a hybrid camera (aka the ability to smack a dedicated record button to record video), the GH3 design suffers in that sometimes it doesn't record.  It's apparently tied to the disappearing overlay displays. If you press the record button before the overlay displays disappear (10 seconds), the record button works. If it's after they disappear, the record button DOES NOT record, it only makes the overlays display. Pressing it a second time starts recording.  But you can't just get used to pressing it twice. If the first press is within that 10 seconds the displays are on, it will start recording and the second tap of the button will stop recording. So you get a second of recorded material and miss the shot.  The work around we're all using for this is to disable the record button and use the shutter button to control recording. Unless Panasonic fixes it in firmware, it's a wasted feature and makes me wonder about Panasonic designers and product managers. Hopefully this and the displays issue will be fixed in firmware.<br /><br />UPDATE 2:<br />Last I used the camera, I found another flaw/bug in it's design. The Custom Settings don't work properly. Custom settings are long a professional feature and were one of the reasons I chose the GH3 over other cameras. Custom settings let you set the shooting settings ahead of time, save them and switch to them instantly. As an example, it's handy in a hybrid camera to have a Custom Setting for video where the shutter speed is a function of the recording format and unlike photography, isn't something in the exposure triangle you manipulate when exposing a shot. Canon cameras implement the function beautifully, The GH3 implementation of the custom settings however doesn't store the aperture, shutter etc. It stores the mode [insert twirling finger] but the aperture and shutter are whatever they were for the last thing you were doing. That's ridiculous.<br /><br />EPILOG: As a stills camera, the lack of an LCD that shows your basic exposure settings at a glance is yet another Panasonic design flaw that makes the GH3 laughable. There's do discreetly checking/changing your aperture, ISO, WB or shutter speed. All the fiddling with the display or drawing it to your face simply takes away from the fun and creative process of photography and coming home with a boatload of great shots. Once again, a lack of design prowess by Panasonic.  IMHO, it's simply a consumer camera. None of the key complaints about the GH3 Firmware were fixed in Panasonic's latest Firmware update. It's clear they have no interest in the camera and have moved development to other products. All told, I recently sold the GH3 and lenses. It was a poor camera purchase. Glad to see it go.\"],\n",

       "        'This is a sweet camera in every way.<br />It was a replacement for the first one I bought from Sunset that had a problem.  When I called them about the problem I first talked to a really nice and helpful guy by the name of Curly, who said \\\\\\\\\"that\\'s defective, we\\'ll replace that as soon as you send it back\\\\\\\\\".  I asked if I could just order a new replacement, instead of waiting for the exchange process, and he said that would be easier and that they would refund my money when they received the returned defective unit.  So, that\\'s what we did.  Curly made it such a simple and painless process.  Then, a few days after my new camera arrived I got a call from Sunset and talked to a guy named Larry who was deeply apologetic while he explained that his tech department found that my returned defective unit was actually working fine after they blew some high pressure air in it.  The big problem is that now they could only refund 1/3 of my money. I got a little steamed about this and reminded Larry that Curly promised a full refund.  I told him that I couldn\\'t give a good review on Amazon if I didn\\'t get a full refund as promised. Larry told me he\\'d look into it and call me back.  Then, the next day I got a call from Sunset and this time it\\'s Mo, who starts yelling at me and whining that he won\\'t be held hostage by threats of a bad Amazon review.  Mo tells me what the Sunset return policy is as listed on Amazon.  Now I got even more steamed and used choice Chicago language to remind Mo what Curly told me when I first called.  Curly did not say anything about having the tech department check it out and nothing about the Sunset return policy.  He promised me a full refund.  Then Mo told me that the only way I could get a full refund, and he says \\\\\\\\\"this is a deal breaker\\\\\\\\\" would be if I gave a five star rating on Amazon.  They got five stars.  I got a full refund.'],\n",

       "        \"Ok so I read alot of review and I bought this camera and there are basically 3 important things you need to know.    -The First is that this is a camera that goes under water.  you have to take care of the seal.  I work on multi million dollar sub for a living and the one thing that is always true with anything that goes under water it's that it needs a greased seal.  No matter how good your O-Ring you need to keep it from being Dry. This camera has 2 major seals that  you have to take out and grease up.  I recommend Dow 111 Silicon gel  it's available for $16 and comes in a tube that will last for about 1-5 years of use. compared with the cost of a new camera thats dirt cheap.  Alternatively you can use Vaseline or most any marine grease.    So you will want to open up the the data port on the side and remove the seal in there and set it aside.  You will want to remove the the door that held the seal to get at the other seal.  Simply push the hinge pin up and out of the door and set the pin and door aside.  This can be done with a jewlers screw driver or a metal coat hanger.  Now remove the 8 screws on the back of the camera and lift the back off of the camera.  Now just remove the seal you find in this cover.    With the 2 seals out all you need to do is smear a thin film onto the seals and reassemble.  you want a wet look but no clumping.  You will want to repeat this with the small in the data door before ever dive, but the lager seal won't need clean and re-greased more them once every 6 months or so.    With that don't you should be leak free as long as you own the camera.    --Second you have to let it air our.  This one is simple but you won't think of it on you own.  When you put the camera away after a dive leave the camera open.    ---Third and this one is my only complaint.  This camera has a fixed focal length.  That means that you have to be about 4 feet away from what ever you want to take a picture of, or it will be out of focus.\"],\n",

       "        \"I am a photography enthusiast that is returning to photography after many years. As a kid, I used Nikon exclusively as my dad had a Nikon F4 and when looking for a camera, I naturally gravitated to a Nikon. I researched several models and decided since this was a long term purchase, I wanted to get something high end and of good build quality that would last a long time. I purchased this camera from a local authorized Nikon dealer and I purchased lenses from Amazon (14-24 G and 24-70 G lenses).<br /><br />In general, the camera has very good build quality and in most aspects is an excellent camera. With a tripod, this camera takes real good pictures. However, i have a few gripes:<br /><br />1) Due to the large resolution and the significant mirror slap, getting a steady image on this is a much bigger challenge than on other cameras. A month after my purchase, I returned to the store to compare this to a D4 and D700 and difference is noticeable. In addition I don't have steady hands so this compounds the issue. I could use a smaller resolution but based on what I have read, the camera down-samples at lower resolutions as opposed to averaging pixels which negates the benefit of a large sensor. However, this can be solved in post processing in software but it is a hassle.<br /><br />2) The left AF issue clearly exists on my camera. It's not something that affects me a lot and worst case I can flip my camera upside down and right focus in the rare circumstances I need to left focus (might not work on a tripod) or just use live view. However, my main issue is that Nikon's support response is not very customer focused. The basically asked me to file an issue and they will get back to me once they decide how to handle the situation as many people have had similar issues. If they are not willing to do a speedy fix, I wish they would maintain goodwill by providing customers with some sort of  alternative or partial refund.<br /><br />Based on the response of my customer service issue, I might re-rate this camera higher. Right now, I actually would rate it a 3.5 because I am somewhere between OK and liking it.<br /><br />==========<br />10/7/12 Update: Nikon agreed that my unit does have the left focus issue and are sending me a prepaid box to send my unit in. Their response has been slow but considering they needed experts from Nikon Japan to verify the issue, I think that it is acceptable. Also, I was initially (incorrectly) led to believe by the customer service agent that my camera would not be fixed in a reasonable time frame but that doesn't seem like the case anymore. If the customer service comes through and my repair process turns out well, I will probably end up rating the camera higher<br /><br />==========<br /><br />11/26/12 Update: it's been three weeks since I got back the camera from Nikon. I got a receipt in the mail about a couple weeks after sending it in. They keyed in my return address incorrectly so it might good to double check with nikon a week or so after you mail it in. They had the camera in their possession for 4 weeks. I've used the camera for the last few weeks and I can confirm that all the AF issues have been fixed. I tested with the 35mm f1.4 prime and the left and right AF points are now very sharp. Overall, I am happy with now and upgrading to a 4 star review from the previous 3 stars. This camera is still more sensitive to camera shake given the pixel width so expect to have to use a tripod most of the time.\"],\n",

Wow was I wrong...<br /><br />I had been a little disappointed with the focus speed of the 5D MKII and had put a couple hundred thousand images on it, so I sprung for the new model.  I was a little worried about the 1.3x crop factor, but thought if they were sharp I could over it.  I photographed a wedding and reviewed the images and noticed they were not super sharp and wasn't in love with the color, but thought that I might be able post process them to be as good as I had been getting from my 5D MKII.  Nope.  Wanting to believe in Canon, I photographed a few more portrait sessions and another wedding with the 1D MKIV.  Then continuing my research and attemping to use the Canon DPP rather than lightroom to process the RAWs, came to same conclusion, JUNK. At this point I felt that I had purchased a $5000 boat anchor.<br /><br />I continued to read all the reviews and the only thing anybody was talking about is the high-iso capabilities.  That's all great, but I would assume that it would also perform as good as the previous generation cameras in the low-iso range.  My 5D MKII files knock the 1D MKIV files outta the water, and here are the key elements:<br /><br />1. LOW ISO NOISE - Where did this come from?!?!  The 100-400 iso images look like 1600 iso on the 5D MKII<br />2. Skin Tones/Textures - Because of the noise and lack of file clarity, the skin tones were never smooth and the color was not as nice as the 5D MKII.<br />3. Focus System - With the more complex 45pt focus on the 1D, I had a tendency to mis-focus regularly (back focus, front focus, etc.)  The most accurate seemed to be using just the center point focus and re-composing once focus was achieved.<br />4. Eyelashes - with a variety of L-Lenses, the 1D was never crisp enough to see them (noise, lack of focus, etc)<br />5. Color Depth - Reds go strange with this sensor.<br /><br />Overall, this camera may be a great piece of equipment for a night sports photographer, but is a terrible camera for most everything else.<br /><br />I returned my 1D MKIV to Amazon a few days after the normal return period and it cost me $1000 dollars.  It was that bad.<br /><br />_____________________________________________________________________<br />Update: June 16, 2010<br />I am still not thrilled with these files, but with the new Lightroom 3 you are able to post process a good bit of the noise away.

Also, Nikon no longer sells parts to independent repair shops. So, if a grey market (that is a camera made for a non-US market) camera ever needs repair, Nikon will not touch it. So, unless the third party somehow can repair the Nikon product(s) -- questionable without access to parts, you will be stuck with equipment that can only be repaired overseas.

So I went on line and looked up the problem, to my surprise, so many people were finding the same problems, soft images and trouble with Auto Focus. Looked up all sorts of things to do to correct it, tried it all, and still , soft images. I refused to give in. I kept trying and trying as I wanted so much to love my 7D. Sadly, in the end, I could not love it, it was giving me such stress and disappointment. I had bought my husband a Sony NEX-5N and gave that to him for Christmas and he was getting better images on that than I was on my 7D. So many people stated that they had to send theirs to canon for calibration 4 X or more, I did not spend $1400.00 to keep sending this back to Canon. Soft images seem to be an ongoing problem with a lot of peoples 7D's. In the end I had to send it back, putting in that box was so so sad. I went to a local NYC camera store and picked up a T3I instead, I came home and was getting the most awesome shots ever. I also have the T1I and this also is giving me better shots than the 7D. This is so sad and so disappointing and I love Canon but I can not understand for the life of me what the deal is with this 7D.

My TI models never failed me yet and I guess I will stick with them. Do your homework before buying a 7D, look up focusing problems on the net before you buy.

The Panasonic Menus are simplified and much better organized and there are almost as many settings.<br />- This camera is built fairly well its a little lighter and a little smaller than the GX7, maybe even a little too small, and the Shutter Release button is not as good. The LCD screen on the EM10 and Viewfinder are not as bright as the GX7's but very decent. The Battery Door is not as solid and the Card slot is too tight and the card release mechanism is not as good.<br />- The Picture Quality and Autofocus is about the same in daylight, but testing both, I give the edge to the GX7 as it is sharper, especially in low light with the Panny 20mm F1.7. The GX7 has much better low light focus as well as picture quality. The EM10 like some of the NEX's tends to get smudgy at high ISOs. Panasonic's Metering and White Balance are also much more accurate.<br />- The WiFi works slightly better than the Panasonic G6 and GX7, but I don't use it much.<br />- Video..what video ?  Panasonic shine in this area by leaps and bounds. Even the G6 Video blows away the Olympus attempt and Video - very disappointing.<br />- Battery life is about the same as the GX7.<br />- The IBIS on this OMD is 3-axis (as opposed to 5 on the EM5/EM1) and it is as effective as the GX7's which has 2. However, the EM10 has IBIS during Video which is a welcome feature, but the video quality is not worth using.<br />- The Panasonic G6/GX7 Time Lapse, Stop motion work beautifully and have more options and can create great videos over the EM10.
