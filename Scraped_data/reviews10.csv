I buy camera bodies often, keep them a year and then often upgrade (I travel for a living).I have yet to find a really good POINT & SHOOT camera to carry for my travels.  They always let me down (Canon included) in performance.Now comes another SL series Canon camera (I thought the Sl1 and SL2 were dismal and cheap) called the SL3.  Still offered in the tacky 'White' version as well as the classic black body.I'm not about to list all of the specs (you can read those on your own by visiting the Canon website) here but I will keep this basic and to the point.  I've purchased two of these (one on the day it was released and another from Amazon).Let's go right to the processor (DIGIC 8)...  This is a rocket ship processor in speed and lighting.  Dark closets, no flash, no tripod, etc, etc, etc all still produced vivid photos when I tested the SL3 I had just purchased.  In fairness, I did use a SanDisk Extreme Pro 300MG card for speed but that card had nothing to do with lighting.  I also used a L-Series IS lens which was e real reason for the superior lighting conditions produced.The camera body is made in Taiwan.  Mostly plastic and very lightweight.  The GRIP of the body is fabulous.  The so-called KIT lens (18-55mm) is sub-par in performance but it's an excellent lightweight inexpensive lens if weight is an issue.  The SL3 will accept both EF-S lenses and EF lenses.Because I travel and carry way too much equipment, I wanted Canon to produce a fantastic Point & Shoot.  They did not.  Along comes the SL3  (red flags already after the Sl1 and SL2).  Was I ever wrong...I was so glad I tried the SL3.  Lightweight.  Even with the basic lens kit (F4 18-55mm lens) made mostly of plastic, it still did a great job of beating out any Point & Shoot.  Plus at only 2 lbs for body and lens with battery.  It was a BMW in performance despite being inexpensive, made of all plastic and a bit flimsy at times for switches and controls.This is no Canon 6D Mark II or 5D IV.  Not even close.  But keep the cost in mind.  Keep the weight in mind.  Mostly, keep that fabulous Digic 8 processor in mind.  So impressive.A great choice.  Actually, a bit under-priced I think.Canon hit a home run in the SL3.

The bag is nice and has plenty of room in it for starting out, and everything in the picture was there.The major drawback I can say about this kit is the tripod they give you with this is a total paperweight.  The bottom portion of the legs are about as thick as a #2 pencil and it does not provide much support at all for this.  I would advise anyone that plans to shoot on a tripod to invest in a better one from the start.  I would not give this enough to knock a star off of the rating though as all of the extras are pretty much free at this price.  It came well packaged and on time from this seller.

It's been a long while now since I bought my Digital Rebel XTi, way back at the beginning of 2007, and I am thoroughly satisfied with this upgrade to the 2017 SL2 model. I vacillated between the SL2 and the T6i, but finally concluded that the SL2 advantages, slight though they were, are better suited to the kind of photography I most enjoy (which is nature, animals, still-life and macro). The SL2 represents a major, major update over my old XTi -- as you'd expect after 10 years.Overall, this is another excellent camera, from a thoroughbred line and I am very pleased. I recommend getting an additional memory card and the OAproda LP-E17 battery 2-Pack with USB charger (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B071SFNX2F/) to go with it. There is a noticeable improvement in the photos taken, even with the same lens, when compared to my older camera.Highlights: The focusing system is excellent, and very fast. Live view is wonderful for framing in awkward shooting positions (e.g. close to the ground) and for tripod work with remote release. The higher pixel density provides much better options for cropping while still being able to produce large prints from the resulting images (especially if the print service uses optical enlargement instead of digital). The colors and exposure automatic setting work much better than my old camera (though I always post-process in DP4). Low-light seems vastly improved, with less noise at the same ISO, but I have yet to use it in a really demanding situation. The feature set is really, really good. I love the triple-shot automatic HDR mode -- it works really well. The menu and settings are very well done and easy to use. Button placement is well thought out and also easy to use.Complaints: None, so far.Accessories: These range from necessary to useful to complete crap. Necessary are strap, charger, battery, memory card (fast and large), card-reader, remote shutter release (a really useful add-on). Useful are the camera bag, flash, flash-extension arm, video handstrap, lens adapters (surprisingly good as a *starter* for macro and telephoto work), and lens filters (UV, C-Polariser and Florescent). Crap are the tripod (don't breathe, it'll shake) and flash shades. The accessories were mainly useful to me in combining with my old body and one lens, to a kit for my kids. The accessories do provide a good starting base and I would have been happy to get them if I was starting out.The flash is nowhere near as good as my Canon SpeedLite but better and more versatile than the built-in. The flash arm was a nice touch.The lens adapters are surprisingly higher quality than I expected, and my kids are putting them to good use -- which suits me fine as I really don't like them using my high-end macro/portrait lens.The camera bag is good as a starter, but on the small size. Really just room for the camera, principle lens, one extra lens and some accessories. My equipment wouldn't fit, and the kids outfit fills it up. Still, not bad at all.Caveat: There is one interesting caveat with this offering. As an upgrade kit for most buyers half of the accessories are redundant and worthless. But for a first-time buyer, the lack of a lens is a huge oversight. So the perfect buyer is someone with an existing Canon EOS camera looking to pass along the old camera body with the kit len(es) that came with the original purchase (as I was).

The evaluative metering works ridiculously well, even pulling off metering of backlit subjects with very little compensation needed. The auto white balance basically can’t be fooled and is the best I’ve ever seen. The touch screen with flippy ability is a pleasure to use. The remote app for your phone actually works unlike some other brands, and you can control your camera with your phone.Reviewers biggest complaint is about dynamic range. Yes it’s true that it’s range is not as big as some, however, if you’re not trying to lift the shadows of an underexposed by two stops image, you’ll never notice. As it is, the pictures this thing takes when correctly exposed are marvelous. It’s fantastic in low light too, with usable images at even 12800 iso.The 6d2 is also a very comfortable camera to hold. It’s ergonomics are top notch. I do wish the outer material was the same as the 5d series, but it’s a comfortable grip nonetheless. The controls are well placed, and once set up you rarely have to dive into a menu.If you plan to record video or do any vlogging, the face tracking rarely falters. It’s pretty remarkable. You can confidently record yourself without worrying about focus, even while walking around town.Overall, the camera is a joy to use, and anyone complaining about it, hasn’t used one, or is just letting numbers cloud their judgment.

The 7xxx camera models have always been a prosumer approach, not quite professional as the D500, but very capable and, with the two command dials, very similar to the pro models.For the D7500, Nikon chose to not increase, but rather reduce the number of megapixels, which directly benefits image quality. I ran several long exposure tests and the camera produced clean images. For this model, Nikon finally enabled the LiveView to be high enough to see through 10-stop ND filters, or to be able to focus at night, as its ISO 1M gives you a bright enough image. If run in video LiveView, you can now also have two sets of parameters, one for high ISO focusing, the other for shooting, something not even the D6xx series can do (only starting with the D750 and higher).Together with the tilting screen, latest processor and familiar feel, this is a highly recommended upgrade to any D3xxx, D5xxx or D7xxx owner.

I have not tried the microphone yet - so I can’t comment on that. In sum, very disappointing for a bundle deal.

It would be at least a month before I could use everything enough to comment on things like quality and durability. So this is my initial impression.When unpacking the items it appeared that some of the boxes had previously been opened so I was a bit wary. However, upon opening the boxes, everything was in its original packaging and nothing appeared to be used or damaged.Canon D6 mkii - There are reviews for this all over the place. I won't go into depth other than to say it works as expected. I've tested it by taking several photos and a video. I used it with and without the battery grip and with and without the flash. It came with a strap, Canon battery and charger in the box.Canon battery grip BG-E21 - I haven't had time to figure out what all the buttons are for, but I did load a couple of batteries into it and attach it to the camera. It is easy to install and works like a charm.Bower Flash SFD740C - This appears solid and rather well made. It is heavier than I expected it to be. It has a built in retractable reflector and diffuser which seems rather convenient and an adjustable power level. It does seem a bit slow to recharge compared to my Canon Speed lite, but it is certainly serviceable. It's a keeper and will go into my camera bag. UPDATE 12/01: When using the wifi app to connect the camera to my phone for use as a remote trigger, this flash will not flash. I thought it might be something with the app, but my Canon 420ex works perfectly so it is definitely a problem with this flash.Vivitar batteries - There were three of these. So far I have charged two with the third one charging as I write this. I can't comment on how long they will last or the quality other than to say they work.Vivitar universal wireless shutter release - UPDATE 12/01: This is worthless and doesn't work.SanDisk Extreme SDXC UHS-1 memory card - It came with 2 of these. Both work and should be capable of storing lots of photos and capturing full HD video. They are SanDisk which is about as good as it gets.Vidpro microphone XM-40 - I haven't used this yet so no comment on it. I already own a Rode so this will likely end up a backup.XIT Photo hard case - No way do I put expensive gear in this thing. It feels like it would fall apart if I dropped it. But I'll use it to store a few accessories that I rarely use or take with me.Ultimax 57"" tripod and Deck Gear 72"" monopod - Cheap and lightweight. I will trust neither to hold my expensive gear. I bought small cameras for my granddaughters for Christmas. These should make good presents to go with them.DM 12 inch tripod - Not exactly sturdy, but easily the better tripod. It will work well on my desk with my Logitech C922 webcam. This one I keep.There is a set of 3 flash diffusers, but I have no idea how to attach them to the flash.Miscellaneous cleaning supplies - Should come in handy.Overall, this package was the same price as the camera by itself so its hard to complain about it. Instead I will say I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of some of the items and will disregard the rest.

The remote doesn't even work for the 6D mark ii. Look at the list of cameras it works with on the paper included (in photo). The flash feels very low quality... I am happy with the mono pod! But the tripod is really low quality as well. Look at the image with the silver tripod leg and how much it bends...? That shouldn't do that. Lol I do it with the mono pod as well and it hardly moves.Other then that the extra batteries and chargers and SD cards are great!

Also, the card reader worked only for 1 day then stopped.I contacted Beach Camera and they were kind enough to expedite ship the hard case and the faster SD cards pictured and replacement of the defective card reader. I didn't want to say anything about the lens keeper which is not a big deal or the SD card case.The Flash (Vivitar) looks like a good quality and worked fine. The bundle included 3 spare batteries -All Vivitar brand, and a travel Vivitar charger. the tripod was light but designed to handle the weight of this camera with a lens, the plate snapped the first time I tried to used it from the weight of this camera and a lens.Overall, I have to say this an awesome bundle for just $50 more and Beach Camera truly take care of their customers.

The camera and accessories were offered at a very attractive price, packaged well, and delivered in excellent condition on schedule .

It has the best image quality of any camera I have ever owned. To name of few of my favorites: Sony RX1RM2, Sony A7RM2, X-Pro 2 and Leica Q. The GFX has recently gotten me to sell my Sony A7RM2. Don't get me wrong, the camera's I just mentioned all are remarkable but the FujiFilm GFX 50S produces the kind of images that wows me on a regular basis. I am pretty much a pixel peeper when it comes to image quality so it's tough to really impress me.I realize that I have bought into a larger camera system, but it is well worth the size and weight for (in my opinion) the major bump in image quality. In terms of handling I actually find that the GFX is much more comfortable to shoot than the Sony A7RM2. Truthfully, I hate the location of the viewfinder on the Sony - it's too deeply set into the camera. I always seemed to be torquing my neck and really jamming my nose into the LCD to get my eye into the EVF. The GFX is much more natural shooting experience. That in itself, for me, makes up for the larger size and weight. By no means is the GFX huge, I'd say it is smaller than most standard DSLRs. It roughly the same size as the Panasonic GH5.So far, I have only tested the 63mm F/2.8 and the Pentax SMCP-FA 645 400mm. The 120mm macro and the 32-64mm should be arriving soon. Hopefully, I'll have more to add after I test those lenses.

The picture quality and dynamic range is amazing.  Perhaps that's because this is the first medium format camera I have personally used, but I could never even afford to look at these before.  I have to agree that this is not really a carry around camera.  Its ISO performance is not as good as my D810 or A7rii, but that was known before I purchased it.  I agree with most reviewers that this should be used with controlled lighting situations where motion is little to none.Since I shoot mostly portrait photography, the detail I have found with this camera is incredible.  I really like how simple the camera is setup.  The auto focus is great. Controls are easily accessible, customization is very easy, menu systems are straightforward.  Unlike with the A7rii, I don't have to go searching for what I want to change.So is it worth the price?  If you are planning on using this like you would a 35mm, then I would say no.  You can get a lot more use range with a 35mm (DSLR/mirrorless) than you would with this camera.  But if you are into taking shots under controlled conditions for very high resolution and spectacular range, then yes.  It's just a matter of how bad you want those fine details for those specific shots.  This darn camera makes me look like I actually know what I am doing.

Using it you get images that are just as exciting but because of modern technology the GFX camera is much more fun to use.  Image quality is just what one would expect for this size sensor.  All the lenses are nothing but Fujifilm quality through and through, especially the 120 mm.  Thank you Fujfilm, and I forgive you for not going full frame.  Hard to put it down and not try to make it my day to day camera to replace the X-Pro2 and the X-T2.  I got it for making large landscape prints with a camera that looks and feels like a real camera, not a computer.  I am very happy with this system and it is worth the price.

Nearly 3 months later and I'm still dealing with Panasonic directly, as RitzCamera won't take any responsibility after 30 days, even if the product is completely broken, unusable, and provided by them.I buy a lot of things on Amazon, and it's not Amazon's fault, but RitzCamera has the worst customer service I've ever seen. I would avoid buying any products from RitzCamera, as there seems to be little to no customer service whatsoever. I bought this thinking it would be a good deal for the price, but ended up wasting 3 months of my time, with what feels like $2000 being wasted. Never again will I buy anything from RitzCamera again, even as little as an SD card.

I mostly used tripods and do lock off interviews and it’s great for that.  But if you don’t have a stabilizer this camera is almost unusable for video (unless your going for that cloverfield look). The low light capability with the dual ISO is where this camera shines(no pun intended).  The battery life is solid, I can run-n-gun a whole day on a single battery.  It’s not that great for photography.  It’s very much a video camera, and aside from auto focus and stabilization it’s pretty good if you can’t afford a full blown cinema camera.

Great color science,14,0,Verified Purchase,"For my style of work, this is an excellent camera. I tend to shoot dimly lit, high contrast subject matter, it excels under these circumstances.Recent cameras I have owned: gh4, 2 a7s2's, a7r2, a6500, a6300The gh5s is far superior to the a7s2, hands down, maybe 20X better color retention in the shadows. Far greater detail in the shadows and almost no pixelation. Panasonic 4k 60fps 8bit footage is far superior to sony a7s2 4k 30fps 10bit recorded externally with an atomos ninja flame. In fact most projects shot on the panasonic never even require 10bit recording because the color science is spot on, and the footage is very pliable in 8bit.Autofocus is significantly better than past panasonic cameras. Not as good as sony. I shoot a large variety of subjects, one of them are MMA fighters, UFC embedded style, which doesn't allow for retakes. This is NOT the best camera for those types of shoots. However if you have enough talent and skills it could be done. The camera does not focus hunt the way past panasonics did, it may go out of focus once in a while, but it will eventually find focus smoothly. The GH4 would constantly switch focus plains over and over which makes footage unusable. I find that the GH5s actually focuses better in dark situations, and struggles in evenly lit situations.If you are looking to take photos I would look elsewhere. Most phones probably work better.When compared to other cameras in this range, this is hands down one of the best out there. It is 100% a film making tool, NOT A YOUTUBER camera. With proper preparation and execution you could almost film a feature film with a set of these. It is on par with lower end RED cameras like the raven, with the exception of frame rates.

Before buying this I already knew about the lack of IBIS so that wasn't a deal breaker for me like others - and I still own the Gh5.  However the Gh5s is such an amazing addition to my Panasonic Fleet! Anyone that owns any MFT camera knows and deals with the fact that low light filming is practically non-existent - unless of course you bring some LED lighting.  With the introduction of a slightly wider sensor and enhanced magic - this Gh5s is superb in low light.  The build feels identical to the Gh5 and the field of view looks slightly larger when teamed up with my Metabones and 18-35 Sigma Art 1.8For those of you that already own the gh5 this is NO replacement - this camera is just another tool in your arsenal.  Although this is a great camera to replace the Gh4 if that's something you already own.  I also like the inclusion of VLOG already installed into this camera - it allows me to play with this video setting before trying to purchase it for my Gh5.Note:- The color science between the Gh5 and Gh5s are slightly different, I suspect that it has to do with the sensor size - in my honest opinion, the Gh5s shows a warmer color science compared to the Gh5- Gh4 and Gh5 batteries and accessories work with Gh5s- Batteries last almost a whole on a single charge compared to the Gh5So far, I haven't had any issues arise from this camera - I'll update this review if it's necessary!

Before I bought this camera, I owned the Panasonic G7, but I have used some cinema cameras as well, so I'll try to compare it to those too.PROS:-Excellent dynamic range (12 or 12.5 very usable stops in V-log), particularly in the shadows. Just remember not to underexpose.-Incredible resolution and sharpness in video, especially in 4k.-Despite small and compressed file sizes, its amazing how much you can push the color in post. File sizes are about 9 times smaller than Blackmagic Prores files I've edited.-Great 4K slow motion in ""Natural"" profile. If you want to shoot in V-log, I'd actually use the 10-bit 1080p 60 fps. Some color issues in 8-bit 4k when grading skin-tones in V-log and 1080p is still sharp.-Lots of things make this similar to a low-end cinema camera. You can get zebras, waveforms, shoot in V-log etc. Lots of room to ensure consistency and I think the image quality is among the best I've seen.-Usability. DSLR ergonomics, great battery life (especially with battery grip), weather sealing etc. I can take this camera everywhere and it's been very sturdy and reliable. Image quality looks great through 6400 iso and very usable through 12,800 iso.CONS:-Variable frame rate over 60 fps is really not good for most situations. Lots of horizontal noise/banding unless you shoot in ""Natural"" profile at 200 iso or less. Above 96fps, some really bad moire and aliasing too. Fun to have the slow motion, but not the most professional footage.-A little bit large for my Zhiyun Crane v2 gimbal. No shake, just hard to go into inverted mode without closing and reopening the touchscreen.-Ergonomics. Great to take everywhere you go, but you'll miss variable ND filters and built-in XLR ports for audio compared to a number of cinema cameras.-Photos aren't that sharp due to ~10MP sensor. No surprise there.

I love it. I'm coming from using Canon cinema cameras (still own a couple) and wanted something in a smaller form factor. Lugging C100 gear everywhere can be cumbersome (beautiful images but cumbersome) so I gave the GH5S a shot. I'm not a huge fan of the original GH5's color science. The skin tones come off very orange (to my eye) but the GH5S has a more natural look. After adding a MB .71 adapter and a Canon 24-105 (which becomes a 30-135 2.8 with I.S.), I'm completely happy. The color science of this camera is beautiful and having 4K 60p or 1080p 4:2:2 in camera is just brilliant. It already comes with V-Log installed which is another bonus. Honestly? I still feel like I have a lot to learn with this camera but so far, I'm really happy with it and it's giving me beautiful images. If I want a stabilizer, I'll use a Ronin or Zhiyun Crane, Monopod or stabilized lens. The color science and low light capabilities are more important to me and it's like using other cinema cameras. Panasonic delivered. 2 thumbs up.

I was having strange issues with the X-T3 periodically not recognizing some of the Fuji lenses I also purchased off Amazon, which would typically require me turn the camera off, detach the lens, reattach, and turn the camera back on. When shooting professionally, or even casually, that was a deal breaker.I have never heard of anybody else having this issue, so I assume I may have received a camera body with some weird physical anomaly, like loose contacts or something. So I am not knocking the review score here. I think the X-T3 is an amazing camera for most people.

You have the ability to really learn the manual interface of this camera and learn true photography/videography!I decided on the XT3 over the Black Cinema Pocket Camera, the A7iii and the EOS R for its superb video capabilities 4K 60 10-bit at 400mbs internal to start and it’s 26.2 strong photo presence. Allowing me to start with a robust multi-use camera from the beginning at a fraction of the cost of the others. The only camera with better video capabilities currently is the BMCC but it has no photo capabilities! This camera is a real “Cinema” camera for the cost of an entry/mid level DSLR or Mirrorless. I’m retrospect it’s priced like an 80D or A6400 but performs like an A7iii or EOS R or S1!As far as the bundle that came with it. For a seasoned professional they would replace every piece with established quality gear, for someone starting from scratch it was priceless bonus that allowed me to invest in other much needed equipment! And a 128gb card for free!!?? This price for just the camera and arguably the best “kit” lens and I mean major “ “ because with OIS in the lens 18-55 and auto or manual aperture, this package is a no brainer for a seasoned professional looking to jump into the Fuji Lineup, someone looking to start from scratch, someone in the middle that wants to take advantage of the amazing cost to value benefit or just anyone who takes photography/videography serious or plans to in the future! This is for you!

After years of going ""cheap"" with APC cameras, going full frame for this price was a no-brainer.  I think the RP is going to be a huge success.  The body is small and light.  I have big hands but find the RP's handling excellent -- button/wheel location is excellent for my needs (mostly amateur travel, portraiture, some sports).  The optional grip works well for a heavier lens, but you can certainly go without.  The build is nice and solid, although the LCD screen if extended seems a tad fragile.  The EVF is sharp and bright.  AF is good if not lightning fast.  You can find several complaints online about the RP (old 6D2 sensor, low FPS, short battery life), but hey, at this price and coming from a 70D, I am very pleased. The RF lens is very sharp and a perfect all-around.  Having the new control ring on the lens is great (I actually programmed it to set ISO).  And Canon is coming out with a dream trio of (hopefully affordable) 2.8 RF L lenses: 15-35, 24-70, and 70-200.  Go Canon.

And the second or so that the screen blacks out between shots really disrupts the flow of a photoshoot for me.

Ive only had the RP for a short time, but here are some of my impressions. All in all, it seems to be a very good camera. Other than the resolution, I still prefer the images from my 6D but as I said, its early yet.I think the body is a little cheapy feeling. The ergonomics are good and you really dont need the extra bottom plate unless you have gigantic hands. It has a good grip and as everyone has mentioned, its very light. Of course until you add some big EF lenses. Other than the nice grip it tends to remind me of a Sony in that everything is minimal, controls are flush to the body, all black. I would have prefered a little better leatherette cover, and some more slr like controls. However, im being picky here and this would all affect the size and weight of the camera.The EVF is a top notch feature.  For landscapes in particular, there really has been no other way but Live View through the LCD, but that has changed. You can almost forget about the rear LCD except for certain purposes, the EVF is that good. It allows you to control everything and see everything including exposure. You can see in the EVF whether the sky is blown out etc. And thanks to drag and focus, you can easily move the focus point , get the exposure you like and lock it in with exposure lock. It is very much like having a peephole LCD. Big points for this.The autofocus is excellent and you can have a combination of them in place at the same time. The eye detect focus from my limited use is very fast and does a great job. If you want to to change the focus, just touch your LCD while looking through the EVF and you can move it, almost anywhere in the frame.There are a number of other great features such as focus bracketing that ive yet to try, but that one has the potential to be great. So all that being said, lets get to the image quality.Anyone moving from an aps-c to full frame Im sure will be very impressed with the RP. With a good lens you cant beat that combination of razor sharp and creamy soft that full frame offers. The colors of course are very good as expected, and here is a surprize. I was expecting the DR to be a real downer but its not. I convert to dng and edit in other programs other than DPP and i was surprised at how much range there is. Its certainly not class leading, but it is very respectable. If you need more than this, you really took a bad exposure. The low light performance is very good, and you can get very respectable images even beyond 12800 ISO with a little work. Now i have to say this, for whatever reason, i still prefer the images of the original 6D. I cant say exactly why, a combination of the tone, color and what i like to call the creaminess is still better for me on the 6D. But again I am splitting hairs. For the most part, the RP is capable of producing images rivaling the best of Canons full frame cameras. And it has a lot of practical convenience features that make this one hell of a camera for the price.

I wish I had known this, I would not have bought this camera. While the camera does allow you to shoot in RAW, you cannot download or open the files on your computer. You have to go to the Canon website and download software. The instructions to do so are confusing, and the instructions on how to actually use the software are even more confusing.Unless you plan on only shooting in JPEG, do not buy this camera.The autofocus and shutter (there is a lag or delay when you press the shutter) are so slow on this camera, don't even think about trying to capture moving subjects. I tried to shoot my dog jumping in broad daylight, and it was impossible. Nothing but complete blur. Also, because it is completely digital, the viewfinder and image display shut off after you take a shot, as it is processing. The viewfinder itself is also digital as well...which totally negates the purpose of having a viewfinder...

I’m a hairdresser who makes much of my living through hair-related social media, just to give you an idea of what I use this camera for as you read on.If you know what you’re buying this is a five star purchase. If you think this camera will compete with a Sony for video or a DSLR for action, then you’re going to be disappointed. This is a “pictures of people” camera that has some very light video features. It’s not a cinema camera, it’s not an action camera. For what it does it is phenomenal— it’s a tiny, lightweight, and FUN camera with intuitive controls that will easily make use of any of that old EF or EF-S glass you’ve had laying around.People complain of the adapter adding length but physics require this, as any pro level mirrorless lenses are longer than similar DSLR lenses. In fact the RF 50mm F1.2L is the same overall size as the EF 85mm F1.2L mounted on the adapter (see photo).I highly recommend upgrading to the control ring adapter, which can be programmed to perform several functions (mine controls aperture in manual mode and exposure compensation in aperture priority mode). In fact one of the last things I saw on this camera that made me decide to buy it was the fact that you can customize the function of just about every button and dial, which makes it YOUR camera and helps to learn all of the features easily (I disabled many things off the bat to make the camera function more efficiently for me)Before I owned this camera I was using a Canon 5D mark iii for studio portraits and a Canon SL2 for vlog type videos. This camera has replaced both of those others, and with a smaller footprint than either. However, I am not an action, event, or low light photographer and my video work is very simple and breezy.I usually like to make big camera purchases from my local brick and mortar, however they didn’t offer the EOS RP without a kit lens, so I bought this package on amazon. I chose this package for the two memory cards, which I needed anyways, but all the rest of the stuff went straight to a donation bin, so I can’t comment on any of its quality.

After going through everything available from point and shoot to small MLC's, I pulled the trigger on the RP. It takes some adjusting from an optical viewfinder but it's not a big deal. Advantages over my DSLR include better focus and WYSIWYG in the electronic viewfinder. The IQ is very good, essentially the same as the 6DMK2. Adapting EF and EF-s glass works without any problems but the lens does protrude pretty far out. The only things I don't like are the auto silent mode, which IMO silent shutter should just be an option and work in manual also. Also the battery is small and there is no power grip available although I have to admit I am getting over 300 pics on a charge as long as I don't do picture previews or use the LCD screen a lot. Overall it is a well thought out camera and the bundle including the EF adapter and extension grip is a good deal.

I also didn’t want to spend an arm and a leg on one of the really high-end Canon models. The RP has been a great choice for me, and after two road trips using the RP I know I have a winner.Size-wise, it’s perfect. In fact, even though I have small hands I found that the grip mount (included in this bundle) is necessary to get a good grip on the camera. The Canon Mount Adapter works as advertised with my existing EF and EF-S lenses; note that the camera does not provide full-frame capabilities with those older lenses, only the new RF lenses.The capabilities of the RP are incredible; just reading the manual can take a while! I think the best way to really learn all of the different modes and settings is to go through each section of the manual and then deliberately set up a photo shoot to try them.Both the EVF and back display are crisp, clear and readable. I appreciated the adjustment on the EVF for my glasses, and the information provided in the EVF is precisely what you’ll need - you can customize it as well. The proof of the pudding, so to speak, is the imaging quality of the camera and I’ve found it to be very good. Colors are bright and saturated, but not overly so. Contrast is excellent, and the resolution of the sensor is good enough to allow sharp printouts in big sizes without pixelation.One negative with both the RP and EOS R is that the .CR3 RAW format is not currently supported by most software. Until it is, you can still shoot RAW + JPEG and work with the JPEG images...waiting for the RAW support in the future.I love the quietness of the EOS RP and the almost total lack of vibration when taking photos. After using this excellent mirrorless camera, I know I will never get a regular DSLR again.

I had been considering the 6D MkII as well and I liked one when I tried it out a while back, but I ended up going with the EOS RP because it would be easier to travel with and would give me a wider range of lens compatibility in the future since it includes an EF adapter.I specifically wanted to upgrade to full-frame and I already have several Canon lenses so I was only considering a Canon camera, so you may want to do your own research about the wider camera market before making a decision if this is your first interchangeable-lens camera.On to the pros and cons of the camera in my time of ownership:Pros:1) Full-frame sensor which means better low light performance and no annoying 1.6x crop factor on EF lenses2) Much smaller and lighter than any other full-frame camera by Canon, and most other brands too from what I gather3) Cheaper than the 6D Mk II even though it has the same image sensor and newer processor4) Able to accept EF and RF lenses; included EF adapter works flawlessly, even accepts EF-S lenses (but only at 10 megapixels)5) For still photography, not much reason to get the much more expensive EOS R6) Canon ergonomics are amazing as always7) MODE WHEEL INSTEAD OF THE STUPID EOS R TOUCHBARCons:1) Worse battery life than a DSLR because the image sensor is always active, plus it uses the battery from the Rebel series, no battery grip available like there is for the EOS-R either2) Much fewer video options than EOS R if you care about that3) RF lens ecosystem is not filled out yet so you'll be using the included adapter a lot for the next couple years unless you're made of money4) No room for a top screenOther points that may help:1) Uses an electronic viewfinder instead of optical.  This has positive and negative effects so I would try out a camera with each to see what you like better2) Less weather sealing than the EOS R3) Includes the most basic RF to EF lens adapter but fancier ones are available if you want--Now, onto this specific package deal.  I have purchased from DigitalGoja before which is why I bought from them this time.  As always the item was securely packaged and I have no complaints there.  Here are the pros and cons of this package:Pros:1) Included accessories are high quality.  MagicFiber cloths are actually my favorite microfiber cloths and one is included, camera case and monopod are good quality for freebies even though they're not name brand.2) Includes 2 memory cards3) Canon authorized sellerCons:1) SD cards are not great for 4K video if that is what you're going to do with this camera (although I wouldn't recommend this camera for that anyway)2) Only includes one battery (but spares are cheap)3) Does not include the grip extender (won't matter unless you have big hands; it isn't a battery grip anyway)--TL;DR: Great ""entry"" full-frame upgrade for Canon users.  Same image characteristics as other Canon cameras.  Can use EF lenses and the new RF lenses, which are all very good so far but not many entry level options exist yet.  Great for still photography but not amazing for video.  Included freebies are good and DigitalGoja is an authorized Canon dealer.Attached image is straight out of the camera with an EF 85mm f/1.8 lens using the included adapter.

The camera and lens mount adapter are exactly as advertised.  The camera does take a little getting used to transitioning from an SLR but it is solidly built and feels good in the hands.  I like the touchscreen but am still holding out on judgment for the 'M-Fn Bar' (though I anticipate that may be an abbreviation for something not so nice).

It's ok with the small lenses, but when I use a big lens, it's a big fight until I turn it off and go for Manuel focus. The view finder is a bit other worldly .

So keeping that in mind, the most important to me is 1. End product the customer is happy with 2. My bottom line.Out of the camera stills are not as sharp as a sony a9, but again compare the price, after some work in lightroom using Canon's dual pixel raw the end product is better. That's right! If you are good with lightroom you will find the canon cr3 raw files do considerably better, especially drawing back the shadows much less noise introduced.I don't worry much about video on this, i have cinema line cameras for that, but the hub-bub about cropping at 4k is silly, don't think ""crop"" think what lense do i need since i know my equiptment. After 30 years, i can look at my scene as a blank canvas, invision what i want to see, make it happen by knowing my equiptment, selecting the right lenses and setting.  If you can't do that, then you'll be a youtuber giving biased reviews based on who gives you what. Please don't listen to them. If this camera does not give you good results it might be you, not the camera!You can use ef-s lenses! Great i have some of those and there good, and inexpensive! So if your my business, scrapping to make a living doing ads from auto manufacturing and corporate fast food mostly things get banged up, cheap is good if the final is good.Very, very rugged. If i didn't break this in a week you won't. It has taken some mud, rain and a 5 foot drop no prob.Oh, you probably spend money on accessories, you can save here too. Same battery as a 5d, 6d, 80d ect. So say you want to upgrade from a 80d you already have the extra batteries!Sigma and tamron lenses i have tested on this, no prob! Dont know why, i put a 2x extender on my 50-500 sigma, still had auto focus. Lens is a 6.3 @500 so you do the math.Feels good to hold, for me nicer than my 1dx, never liked how a nikon or fuji felt. Sony is on par, but it's preference.To be fair, i only use this for candids and set photo ops, sometimes auto exects travel to give input on ads, they may be visiting from japan or germany to detroit so i send them away with some free 8x10s or whatever. That's the limits for me with this type of camera, so keep in mind my opinions are that, i don't do weddings or cheerleading squads or that type of thing.Are worried about 2 cards?  Do what i did monday, download the canon connect app, connect your camera to tablet set it to auto load, end of the day all your raws are on the card and on your tablet, use dropbox have your office push them to your in house cloud. Have your assistant process and print, while they do that take your client to lunch, when you get back to your office they will be surprised to see beautiful prints waiting on the confrence room table! And you have 3 raw copies and didnt carry around 100+ dollar sd cards in your pocket! Problem solved man.Your probably concerned that little swipe bar button thing is a joke? It's not, in fact its my new favorite thing, hold for 5 secs to activate. I have ot set so-swipe iso up down, or bump left for auto iso or bump right for 100 iso. After 5 secs it deactivates and doesnt ""move by mistake screwing up shots"" as one blogger thats biased reported. He and his wife are just upset they can't get their cameras to work like mine, and not worried what car they should buy to complement thier 458 like i am. Can't afford the hybrid, I'm just a photographer ya know.Bottom line, i bought this to try it, waited a while to make sure there were no big issues. I'm a local small business and support such, lucky for me my brick camera store sells on amazon, today i went to such store to talk shop and place an order for 3 more, getting the control ring adaptor this time! Nice featureSo, you can get a camera with a 5d sensor, adaptor and backpack (i just toss it on a closet but at least its there) a decemt strap, micro cloth and some other junk for 2grand. And your reading this? Just buy the thing will you, and learn who to listen to, how to use lightroom photoshop premier pro dimensions and you'll be fine.Oh yeah, while not ibis, there is a digital stabilizer in video modes. I used enhanced and it worked. Yes, stabilization in lense is much better, not getting into that though but it is. Now stop worring about what camera to buy and whatching gear youtubers and go use one!

Also acquired the Canon 70-200mm f4L II USM lens. Awesome package!!Wife and I attended a grade School theatre musical (Beauty and the Beast) the next day. The stage lighting was constantly changing with multiple colors and very dark. I placed my EOS R on manual and canon lens on f4. Placed ISO on 4000. When I needed to get in closer than the max 200mm, I flipped from FULL to Crop 1.6 sensor and my lens instantly went from 112-320mm. What an awesome feature. I set my shutter to silent at the beginning of the musical but realized it was pretty loud in the theatre so I changed back to H continuous and cranked aware without disturbing anyone. Needless to say, I love this camera and lens. I can't wait to have the time to really learn all of the features. I'm pumped and this is my 1st full frame camera!

Bigger sensor than my APS-C in the 7D, RAW images are sometimes 65MB+ so lots more data in them. Gorgeous images. Too many features on the camera to list but the biggest surprise is the value of the touchscreen for so many of the  settings and even taking an image by tapping the screen. Only drawback thus far for the screen is forgetting to fold it out of harm's way when putting the camera away.Most difficult thing to deal with is that not many post-processing tools handle CR3 RAW files (i'm not Adobe's biggest fan).Also, the camera eats batteries for breakfast. I have a total of 5 but I used to get a full day of shooting out of my 7D and even with energy-conserving settings on the R, I'm getting about 3-4 hours (and there is NO built-in flash to suck the juice.So far, I have not spent that much time with it but silent mode is awesome for events and nature photography.I'd recommend this new model for any individual who is a serious advanced non-professional on up.

Looked around and found this really nice kit from Digital Goja. I have bought many items from them in the past and I have to say their Quality Control is pretty good. Most of their items are very well made. Economically kit made the most sense. All the items are well made. The bag has good stitching and doesn't look it will crumble apart anytime soon. I won't lie I do not use this to keep my EOS R in I use it for peripherals and my Canon M50. I have another bag for this EOS R. I use this bag as my grab and go. The EOS R is mainly a studio camera. The other items; the monopod, quick shoulder strap are all very nicely stitched. The hand strap I am not familiar with using and I am not sure if I will use it because it means the camera kinda flops around. I would have liked to have seen the backside hand claw grip made by Altura with the same quality. However I have it should I need it.CONS: The only thing that could have been better would be if the memory in this kit was Lexar. (95/mbs or better) I like Lexar they are one of the fastest cards and in my experience haven't failed me.So if you look around I don't think you will find a better kit. Economically or quality kit items. So if you are looking for an EOS R body I would recommend getting this kit. Digital Goja, great job.Side note: AMAZON why can't I use shift to select multiple pictures for a one time upload to do this review? I have to upload each one individually. PITA

Only thing that annoys me is that if I try to do something on the touch screen (which works really well), and I bring my hand in from the right side, it is detected by the sensor below the eyepiece causing the touch screen to turn off.Seems to be lot of online info on set up and use of Canon R. Manual included is in English. The included adapter for my lenses seems to work perfectly.

To me, making a $700 camera with a constant grinding noise is a monumental engineering design flaw, and apparently give the discussion about it on one of the major photography sites, I am not the only person who feels this way. That noise notwithstanding, it would be an awesome camera and otherwise my first choice for an advanced point and shoot.

I was only on day two and now can only use my phone to take vacation photos so no photos near water! :( I wish I could return this and get my money back as it is a HUGE WASTE OF MY MONEY!

A few months later I fell on some steps in Florence italy, while the camera was around my neck but turned off and with all moveable parts closed. There is slight cosmetic damage, but the zoom seems to works normally. ""Seems,"" because the other electronics are shot. The shutter doesn't respond and both the LCD screen and the viewfinder stay dark & useless.When I took the P900 to an excellent camera repair shop which I've used before (for Canon cameras and lenses), I learned that the P900 ""cannot be repaired."" It turns out that means it can only be repaired by Nikon.The P900 was recommend to me by a friend who is a professional photographer, and I accept I was probably at fault. I banged my knees up pretty badly, too. So I did not contact Amazon or the Amazon seller or Nikon. But I like the camera. I  ordered a 2nd P900 on June 21st from an Amazon seller named ""Pixiebytes""--perhaps that cutesy name should have been a warning. It arrived June 25. Since I already knew the model, I did not use it much before a second trip to Italy, July 21-August 5. For about a week the new camera seemed to be working fine, but then one day I turned it on and the LCD screen remained dark. It is still dark and useless. The view finder works and one can even review photos on the SD card, albeit it poorly and with difficulty since the images are very small.It seems obvious to me that the second P900 was defective. The issue might be wiring from the camera body to the LCD screen, or it might be in an internal sensing mechanism. The P900 has both a 3"" LCD screen and an electronic viewfinder. Normally it senses if your eye is at the viewfinder and only activates the LCD if you're not using the viewfinder.Amazon has an inflexible 30-day return policy, which apparently includes defective products and which its independent sellers are free to enforce or not enforce.  30-days from my receipt of the camera had already passed when the problem arose and neither Amazon nor Pixiebytes will let me return the camera for refund or replacement.  Pixiebytes (which should change its name to  ""Warning"" Pixie Bites"") wanted to know why I didn't contact them within 30 days. No matter that 30 days had just passed and I was in Italy when the LCD stopped working; no matter that I do not usually take purchase information and receipts with me when I travel.A few days ago I contacted Nikon and the agent I spoke with was both helpful and sympathetic. I learned from her that there is a ""Gray Market,"" and if my camera was purchased from a seller on the Gray Market Nikon will not repair it.  (Grey Market products are manufactured for promotional purposes, not for sale.) If it's a full-fledged and fully backed Nikon, the cameras--both cameras--may be covered by Nikon's warranty. Unfortunately, the serial number of the second camera alone would not reveal if it is a Gray Market camera. (I couldn't locate the first Nikon while on the phone.) That can only be determined after I send it in. I intend to send both P900s.BUT LET THIS BE A WARNING TO ANYONE TRYING TO FIND A BARGAIN ON AMAZON:BEFORE YOU BUY ANYTHING LIKE A CAMERA FROM AN AMAZON SELLER, MAKE SURE THEY ARE A DEALER AUTHORIZED BY THE MANUFACTURER. AMAZON DOES NOT VERIFY THIS WHEN THEY ALLOW SELLERS TO LIST (IE, ADVERTISE) ON AMAZON.COM, AND SELLERS LIKE ""PIXIE BITES"" DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT IF THEY CAN POSSIBLY AVOID DOING SO.The two P900s cost me over $1200. I'd have saved money (and time, and frustration) had I bought just one camera at closer to list price from a genuine Nikon dealer.

It just came with the quick start guide.The BUNDLE is missing the software CD which admittedly I might not have used anyway, but it still shouldn't have been listed if it wasn't going to be included.There's a few other things like the accessories that came with the camera (strap, battery, cords) are all re-taped with scotch tape after noticeably being opened and the original tape is still on the plastic packaging.There have been serial number stickers created to cover where I'm assuming the original serial number would be on the outside of the box. Although it does match the serial number on the bottom of the camera. Which I supposed could have also been fabricated.I don't really know how to feel about this because the camera itself seems legit. Is it a stolen camera? Is it refurbished? Is it an old model? Is it fake?I will definitely update if anything changes and can upload pictures if anyone needs to see them.

In fact the biggest problem I have had to date is learning how to properly use all those features since they exceed my old 35 mm SLR camera and all my high end point and shoots digitals.  The video quality is excellent.  Many folks complained in reviews that their was not external microphone port but my camera had one directly the left of the hot shoe.  It accepts a shotgun microphone as well.  So far I am loving this camera.

Lord knows what it is supposed to connect to but certainly nothing most folks have. And, yes, all devices are up-to-date as were all apps/programs/drivers downloaded and installed for the purpose. The odd thing is that it often ""sees"" the devices, it just refuses to connect to them. And, yes, they can connect to other wi-fi devices ... all our printers are  wi-fi and the home network is wi-fi and, in fact, my Android phone often gets control of the LG television in the doctor's office much to my amusement as I change channels on the unsuspecting patients waiting. ^_^ Maybe it's waiting for me to buy a Fuji computer ... trust me, the camera will still be waiting when something else freezes over.Actual photos. Well, they definitely leave something to be desired when compared with my Panasonic DMC-FH20 or Kodak P850. Auto focus is sketchy at best and at times as slow as the Kodak. One cannot take pictures of subjects that are backlit (which both Panasonic and Kodak can do). And indoors color selections are often way off the mark. And, forget night photos unless a bank of spot lights is illuminating the subject. Selecting automatic modes or tinkering with manual modes or any of the preset modes doesn't seem to help a whole lot.Earlier today I accidentally recorded a movie -- the movie button is separate and next to the ON/OFF button ^_^ -- and when I told it to erase the movie, it deleted all 500+ photos on the memory card without so much as a how-do-you-do or way to recover same.And just now, when I plugged it into a USB port to charge ... it don't wanna! < eyes rolling >. I disconnected and reconnected. No joy. Disconnected it, turn it off and reconnected it. Waited for an hour. Now it's charging. Apparently not only can you not take photos but you cannot charge with the camera on either. I guess you can USB or charge but not both. < more eye rolling >.If I could get my $240 back (camera, spare battery and 8GB Class SD card) I would do it in a heartbeat.

So, I ordered this and couldn't be more pleased.Shipping was quite swift.  There was a mixup on the charger included, and Beach Camera swiftly made good on that.  I have to say I am impressed by all the stuff they included.  The Sony carrying case is very sturdy and could probably be dropped without damage to the camera.As to the camera, I upgraded from a Coolpix P80 which I used a lot for some years and liked for most of its features until I decided recently that there was something better out there.  However, this tiny but heavy little powerhouse, the RX100- III outshines the Coolpix by 500% in my opinion.  There is a learning curve to get to know all the features, but here are some I am already aware of.  First it has several little focus squares when you focus if you use the iP (intelligent focus) setting.  It goes to macro automatically in that setting and the results are pretty amazing.  It shoots well in dim light too.  It also shoots movies (very easy, again, to do, you just put it on iP and push the record button!) and you have a very clear movie which will record for about 29 minutes, the book says.  I haven't played the sound of my test movie on regular speakers but recorded Christopher on harpsichord.  The camera also has a stop action feature that takes 10 frames per second so you can go to a horserace, swim meet or the like and record in motion.  Haven't tried that but can hardly wait.I have ordered a book which explains all the features so think there's still a lot more to learn, but in the meantime, think this little camera is a great cross between the highest end portables and professional ""big"" cameras.  I am not a professional photographer but very much like taking pictures.I would recommend this camera, and also the company I bought it from.

I was pleasantly surprised when I opened it. I mean, I saw videos saying that it's gonna be small, and that it would fit in your pocket, but I was not expecting it to be smaller than my phone (iPhone 6).• Free accessories for almost the same price if you were just buying the camera  ○The Memory Card works perfectly  ○The SD Card Reader also worked like a charm• Camera was new and fully functional (Still trying to learn the features) but I didn't find scratches, dents, whatsoeverCons:• Not all the accessories are Reliable.  ○ Screen Protector is VERY Thin, I didn't even  attempt to apply it on my camera, I recommend that you purchase a separate Screen Protector  ○ The Batteries that came along with the Bundle seem to drain quickly. (Tried recording a video in XAVC S format, and it took only 15 mins to completely drain one battery.) I'm not sure if this is  normal, so please let me know.  ○ The screw on the Red Spider Tripod is a little loose, the screw part on the top is removable though, so you can tighten it by removing that top part, and manually screwing that top part to the camera, then clipping the top part back on to the Spider Tripod. But this could be a tedious task in future uses.Overall: there were no major issues with this bundle, yes one or two items that were included seem to be cheaply made. But most of the items work fine! and the Camera itself works Great! so I'm still pretty satisfied with this purchase.

Like with most things, i over researched it.  Obviously i exceed my budget, but worth ever penny.  This camera makes it look like i know what i am doing...  It has more capability than i currently know how to use, so things will just get better with time.  I short note about buying the III vs the other RX100; tilting screen is a plus, not all the others have that; 24-70 fast lens is outstanding; built in ND filter is amazing; for me III was best choice, even over the VI or V.  This camera competes with pictures my friends are taking with their DSLR and in a lot of cases it is better.  One note on the 24-70, that isn't as much zoom as you might think so if you are wanting to take close ups from far away this may not be for you.  My solutions was just use the old school zoom, and walk myself a bit closer to my subject.

I have a small Fugi camera that is nice but just doesn't cut the mustard, especially doing video. The Sony RX100 III really fits the bill. The battery has a decent life span when shooting video, and the ability to shoot stills in RAW is great. The 20.1 megapixel sensor is sweet! The camera controls are almost as extensive as my professional camera and easy to use with a wee bit of practice. It's small size allows me to always have it with me, but the down side is that it can be hard to use with big hands. I recomend getting the grip accessory. It really helps. The pop up viewfinder actually works well! I had my doubts about it. Nice for those really sunny days. The tiltable view screen has been a real plus and I was surprised - the little built in flash works quite well with the software doing a good job of blending it in well with existing light.

The lens on this camera, while sharp enough for most purposes, does not yield resolution quite as fine as the Sony.  For my purposes, except for enlargements of landscapes, the lens on the Kodak is better than adequate.  This camera is fun to use with a firm ergonomic grip design, a viewfinder in addition to the LCD screen, good controls and a menu which is reasonably simple to navigate.  There is one odd limitation which I did not expect:  the aperture does not close down smaller than f/7.4, and I would prefer at least f/16 for landscapes.

It has an incredible zoom, 65x, and its image stabilization works beautifully to give you non-blurred images for hand held telephoto and low-light shots.  I've never experienced image stabilization like that before.  It has a very nice tilting LCD and of course an eyepiece viewfinder as well.  I appreciated its light weight and the ability to take macro photos at very close range.  I did not shoot video at all, so this review is based only on still shooting.There are a couple of bugs that do tend to get in the way of a fully enjoyable experience.  The principal one I kept running into was the camera unfocusing at moderate zoom levels.  It would focus and then unfocus.  The only way to get it to focus was to change the zoom level up or down, and by that time you may have lost your photo opportunity.  I also had the camera freeze a couple of times, and had to pop out the battery and push it back in to reset the camera.  This was in cold weather, so perhaps that was related, as my iPhone will sometimes do the same in the cold, when the battery cannot provide the necessary power.  The difference is that the iPhone shuts off, whereas this camera froze.The image sensor may be what is expected from a ""bridge camera"" such as this, but unfortunately I cannot honestly say ""this camera takes really good pictures.""  The sense I get from my iPhone 6 photos is that they are better in general.  A lot of that has to do I think with this camera's very limited ""dynamic range"", which essentially means the ability to handle scenes containing both bright and dark areas, which in my experience occurs frequently.  With this camera, the whites are often washed out.  The iPhone has an auto-HDR mode to handle this, and it is true that this camera also has HDR (which takes 3 shots and combines them), but you have to go through the menus every time you turn on the camera to enable HDR, and then taking photos becomes slower and uses the battery more quickly.  The camera has another mode called WDR, but I didn't find it helpful.  I think that mode is really intended for video scenes.  But even without HDR processing, a good camera ought to be able to produce decent images for high contrast scenes, and this camera really does not make the grade.

It has excellent image stabilization but when you push the camera to the limit you should hold the camera still because you are probably shooting at a fourth of a second shutter speed.I did not like pictures where the Auto mode selected ISO 3200, they were grainy.  Setting it to P with auto selection of the ISO but also limiting it to ISO 1600 gave much better pictures.  This is a two step process, read the manual.In moderate to good light it is a great camera that weighs a fraction of the DSLR I have at a very low price.I have used it for about a month and it has performed flawlessly.  If it keeps working I will be very pleased.I saw a black spot on the side of a tall dead tree.  I hand held the camera, zoomed to 1200MM and clearly saw the eyes of a wood pecker staring back at me.

When I was forced to use the one provided with the camera it kept stopping my recording say it was due to the memory card speed writing capabilities. I didn't get that with my card ever.I am also dissapointed as the usb reader came broken. I decided to keep it anyway but it was literally in two pieces. Such a shame.Maybe when I get used to this camera it will preform better, but a lot of things it has is basically things I could do in a photo editing program only on the camera which is kind of nice, but I'd rather its focus worked better. It is a very complex focus series you can choose from. I will continue to work with this camera but I'm wondering if I should have went with a Sony.

The Picture quality with the zoom beyond 700mm is not the quality I expected, become grainy.  The Burst settings are delayed, and the quality is not clear.  It does not capture fast moving objects, Like race cars on a track, clearly.  Overall, It might be a fair camera for the money, but not what I expected from the review I read.

Got many many compliments for my shots and the price is the best thing. For Canon, Nikon and other brands you pay almost double price and sometimes you don't even get these features. WiFi works really great and I use it always to transfer the pics to the Android app and I love the touch screen which some others also don't have. Sometimes it has almost too many settings, but if it gets too much, you can use the automatic modes, which are very good in 90% of the times.One of my best camera buys in the last years for sure.Attached a few of my recent shots at the beach.

It is a bit confusing to operate to say the least.  I work as an auto damage appraiser so I need a camera that will work in adverse weather conditions, take clear photos quickly, take clear macro photos, work well in low light conditions, will time/date stamp the pics - this camera seems to not have that function (it is not listed in the owner's manual) a good zoom is very helpful for clear photos on campers and equipment.  I have only taken a few photos in the home - it does not have an internal memory.  The photos seem good but w/o a time/date stamp I cannot use the camera for my job.

I also have not tried the wide angle or tele accessories lenses.  with a 20mm -1200mm zoom i dont see the need.  I have tried it for moon shots and am happy with that too.  I also put the app on my smart phone for remote shutter.  that also works great. I haven't tried the GPS location app with it tho.  about the only thing i wish it had was built in GPS tagging.  It takes a while to figure out the technology and how to use it to get the best out of it.  It's not heavy, and you can fit 55mm filters, lens hood, and other lens accessories on it. Also has hot shoe for attaching better flash or finder sights, and accessories for video.

I’d rather pay a little more and get more; this wasn’t much better than a phone camera. It’s good for situations when you are worried about losing your phone and rather use something less valuable. A big plus is how easy it is to transfer pictures between your phone and the camera.

I had purchased four different models and had been using them for years, but wanted to try something else. I canyoneer and destroy cameras all the time. I had an older version of the Stylus Tough, so I tried this one. It takes amazing photos. If you shoot Raw format, you have all the information in the highlights and shadows to easily color correct the image. The old camera would just make the sky white with no information to color correct it. As you can see from the photo I posted there is a pretty good contrast between the light and the dark and there is almost no 100% white. The only two negatives I have is that Olympus puts OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA in the description and it has to be manually removed before uploading. If not, that'll be your caption. And secondly, Olympus Raw format is not supported by Apple Photos so you have to open them up in Adobe Lightroom.

Based on the reviews here and at DPreview, it sounded like a great option.I won’t fault the camera for image quality, since she was using it on Auto mode and most of the photos and videos turned out ok.  It struggled a bit with correct exposure due to high contrast of bright sky and darker canyon interiors which is to be expected.But this camera gets one star for the simple reason that it’s sold as a rugged camera designed for the water and the yet the lens is so horriblely  scratched after two weeks that I have to assume it’s not actually made from glass as advertised or some kind of cheap plastic.  She says she was using her shirt to wipe water of the lens once in awhile and that’s it. Unless the sun was directly behind her many of the photos have noticeable haze.You shouldn’t have to baby a camera that’s designed to function in dirty and wet environments.  I would not recommend this to someone who intends to use it in the way it’s advertisedUpdate: sent the camera back to Olympus to have the lens cover replaced and have been quoted $130.26 for the service.  Total rip off.  I’d return this if I could.  Will never buy an Olympus camera again.

I keep the camera in an old sock in a hard cover little camera case.  Underwater I'm very very careful.

It was great. This one is a little thicker but the flip up LCD is very handy for taking pictures in tight areas. It can help you get an entire door in a tight Italian hill town street or better take a photo over your head in a crowd. I quit taking my DSLR on vacations because this camera is so capable. The optical zoom range is incredible! I prefer a neck strap instead of the hand strap that came with the camera. I made one from a shoelace while traveling.

The Zeiss lense and 21MP do an excellent job at capturing the moments. The only downside is it has a very small sensor, the smallest on the market, so darker images will be more difficult. The upside is that the new technology makes it functional. It is one of the cheapest cameras on the market with grade image stabalizationtion. It also has a built in sharpen feature you can enable. It has the program feature like older CyberShot and other point and shoot cameras. The colors are vivid and all around it seems well built. I purchased an Otg cable on Amazon for less than $4 and upload my photos to my phone. The battery seems to last long.

Very little to dislike - mainly the use of the old style micro-usb that seems to always fail rather than the new type.  The apps are fair at best - but they are not the camera. They camera itself takes amazing pictures.  ALTHOUGH while waiting for the RX100M6 to arrive ... the RX100M7 was announced.THE REAL PROBLEM is the stuff included from Beach Camera in the package.First the DecoGear ""Deluxe Starter Kit"" which got thrown in as an accessory  I would write DecoGear but it seems they don't sell this anymore. WELL the bottle of lens cleaner in side was not sealed well and everything in the package was covered with gook which consisted of lens cleaner having dissolved some other stuff. A mess.So I just trashed that - but you can see it in the photo attached.There were a few other useful things in the rest of the accessories, particularly the extra batteries - ALTHOUGH - the photo in the Amazon Ad showed the extra battery as a Sony one - IT IS NOT.  It is Vivitar.I have had quite a lot of issues with Vivitar camera batteries in the past - mainly very short life.  Well see if they have improved.  REVISION: the Vivitar batteries have a VERY short life. Probably have of the Sony - which is not longer enough either.  So these are a bad deal too.ONE MORE PROBLEM - the supplied Corel Paint Shop Pro 2018 (not X9 as advertised), S/W is GARBAGE.  If you try to read a DNG file, it will lock and you have to kill the program with task manager.  And if you read the .ARW files from Sony - you get a Magenta sky - SERIOUSLY.  I was able to read the DNG files in Adobe LR 5 - and they look just fine.  This Corel S/W is trash - no wonder they threw it in.Again, this is the Beach Camera ""package"" - it has nothing to do with Sony.

I am a hobbyist and have been using SONY cameras for a few years now and they have not disappointed me.  However, carrying all the equipment was not convenient for many situations and I was looking for a compact camera I could carry for those situations.  This is that camera!  The quality, flexibility and convenience of what they have packed into this camera make it just what I was looking for.  I now wonder how many times I will want to carry all my equipment when I travel when this compact camera will likely fill most of my needs.

All the indicated items were included and factory sealed except for the case which arrived three days later.  I rate Beach Camera with five stars for promptness and for sending clean unopened packages.  There were also a few nice surprises that were included but not called out directly.Of course two spare batteries are highly welcomed and my package included a 12V charging cord and Euro AC adapter that were not called out in the descriptive copy.  As I use Mac computers, the Corel software package is not of use to me, but PC users will probably find it useful if they're not already committed to Lightshop, Photoshop or its variants.  Note that the SanDisc SD card included in this package is rated as speed class 3 so should get most users off to a proper running start.This review is obviously not a review of the camera per se but rather the package that Beach provides.  I judged it to be the best value of those on the Amazon page at this time which is why I selected it.  If you've decided on the RX100M6, this package is easy to recommend and I think the best value of those listed on Amazon at this time.As for the camera, I have to agree with the rest of the world's reviewers that this is a very expensive way to get a full time carry camera but if you're looking for some reach and want a small package, this is a good way to go.  Sony's descriptions and menus are just as annoying to learn as so many say it is but the hardware itself is excellent.

Amazing camera in a compact powerhouse of a package. For those that know smart phone cameras aren't good enough yet, but also don't want to carry around anything larger like an SLR or larger mirrorless ones. The bonuses that come with it aren't entirely accurate, I.E a 64GB SanDisk card came instead of Lexar, among other things, but that's ok! Not mad. It beats buying this directly from the Sony website for the same price, with no extras. Very satisfied with this purchase. It'd be perfect if it had USB-C instead of Micro USB, and a Microphone jack.

I was disappointed however when I got the camera to find out that there was no warranty with it and that it the appeared to come from China. All of the information on the box was written in Chinese. I also was not aware that you needed to manually open the flash each time you were going to use the camera. I have never had a camera where I needed to do this.  I  I find that the photos tend to be over exposed because the flash is too bright and the camera requires you to raise the flash for each photograph. This was a gift for my daughter so she is thrilled with what It can do but I personally prefer a more advanced camera.  This camera is not for someone who is looking for a good quality camera for somewhat serious photography.  I do like that the camera comes with a rechargeable battery.

I thought the fold out screen would be an advantage but really it just makes the camera heavier, harder to hold, and off balance.My big gripe however is the shutter speed in auto mode.  I've seen dead toads click and shoot in succession faster than this camera operates.Frankly, if you're going to stay in business against the improved optics of a cell phone, you can't go back in quality.  The logic controlling this camera is NOT as spry and nimble as the camera it replaces.  It is sluggish.I'm sure I could play with walk arounds with non-auto settings but here's the thing, I DIDN'T have this complaint with my prior Canon camera with the same settings.If I could return this for my money back, I'd like to do it.

But I'm giving it and Canon a one star because i just spent over 5 hours with customer service (the 1st rep apparently disconnected out of frustration) to figure out how to download photos to my laptop!  First off, it doesn't come with a cable to download photos on my mac, so I had to download the Canon Image Gateway and needed a WIFI connection to download images.  The photos also do not download directly onto my photo app (as my older Powershot camera - which was much easier and user-friendly) - it only downloads onto the Map Utility and then I would need to transfer the photos over to the photo app for editing.  And, I can't even begin to say anything nice about the user manual, which is useless - one needs a Canon degree to figure things out.  I have a number of professional cameras (mostly Nikon)  and have NEVER had such issues in the past.  The user manual that is provided with the camera is a very basic set-up manual (with many languages and only a few pages dedicated to English) and requires that the buyer go on line to download a detailed manual (which again is almost useless).  Canon (as well as other technology companies need to learn how to focus on making things simple! I'm almost tempted to return this camera because I refuse to spend hours and hours trying to figure how all of the main features work!!!!  This will probably be my last Canon product!!! I've had it!  If you can't make products user-friendly, then don't make it at all please!

It’s never been plugged in overnight or left plugged in after it’s done charging. And the Canon battery still works perfectly fine. I liked this bundle, but if the spare batteries are like this it might be better to find a similarly priced bundle with better/more items and just buy a spare Canon battery instead.

I took some photos in my kitchen without flash and then zoomed in on a small object 4.5 inches square and about 12 feet away also without flash.  The kitchen lighting was good enough to get surprisingly good photos.  I've posted the zoomed photo out of camera and then after a little post processing.  I then went outside and took a couple of photos with the street lights on.  Again I was surprised at how good the photos are.  Obviously they are somewhat grainy and not what I'd get from my DSLR with an L lens, but surprisingly good.  I can't wait to get out there in daylight.  I can tell I'm going to like this camera as a step up or two from my Canon SX50 that I still have and love.  The viewfinder and LCD are greatly improved over the SX50 and the zoom is better.  With this camera and with my SX50 I almost always shoot on ""auto"" and like to use it for trips and bird photos.  I usually do some post processing in Paintshop Pro 2019.  I like zoom!  The bird photos show the zoom ability... the woodpeckers are on top of a telephone pole a long way off.  The cardinal is about 20-30 feet away.

The package came much faster than expected and was in perfect order when it arrived. A subsequent question I had was answered courteously and fully. I received everything described in the ""package"" of components that I ordered. Accordingly, this is more a suggestion for Canon than a comment on Ritz: not included as a standard part of the camera was the ubs connector needed to download pictures to a computer. Nor was the required connection compatible with past Canon ubs connector ports, so my old Canon connection would not work. Accordingly, I had to make a second order for the cable - - a measly three dollar item - - and wait a week for its delivery before I could transfer my photos. Bad marketing on Canon's part!

I bought this one for the updated lens, increased pisxels and speed of shooting, as well as the panorama function.  However, I rated it only 4 stars for 3 reasons.  Changes fro the SX50 systems that I used and liked are missing from this updated version: 1. there is not a automatic folder generation for pictures for each day as previous.  I can do it manually, but I though it was a nice feature to capture each day in a separate folder automatically; 2. Having been ill and unsteady, I was used to shooting with the flip screen at a 90 degree angle as i used the straps to be me some stability, however in the SX70 the screen shuts off before the 90 degree angle, maybe at 67 degrees; and 3. during the review of pictures the SX50 and a dial that could be rotated to review pictures, with the SX70 the forward or reverse ""dial"" has to be pushed.  All of these do not affect the pictures, but just my convenience.  Overall still the best camera for me, as I do not shoot the situations where the reviews say the camera is lacking, like low light.

As yet, we have not had an opportunity to use the camera, but we are sure it will be fine. The one thing with this camera, the owner is required to remove the memory card to transfer pictures, also have to recharge the battery but placing the battery into a pludgin. Their previous model all you had to do was plug the camera into a USB port on our laptop and both functions were accomplished at the same time. Just different I guess.

B07P3FLZJK,R1VF0X98I27PY7,Amazon Customer,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGE4G6O76SEWMBOPY3EH2BUFRZFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"March 29, 2019",4,First impressions - I'm a fan,37,0,Verified Purchase,"I'm an amateur photographer who is an admitted fan of Nikon Coolpix cameras. Prior to the arrival of my new A1000 on 25 March, I had previously acquired a Nikon Coolpix P530 (since gifted to a family member), B700, and P1000, in that order. The sequence reflects my desire for greater and greater optical zoom (42X > 60X > 125X). It also is an indication of my quest for additional features like capturing RAW data files. My primary subjects are landscapes and wildlife. For those who may not have a feel for the actual size of the A1000, the first two images I've included compare it to my B700 and P1000.When I saw the announcement for the new A1000, I was intrigued. Although it has less zoom (35X) than my current cameras, it has nearly all of their features and a couple that neither the B700 or P1000 possess. It has a touch LCD screen, for one. It also has the ability to select the number of shots (3 or 5) that the camera will take when Exposure Bracketing is enabled. This is a plus for using external software to process a series of High Dynamic Range (HDR) images.Since I've only had the A1000 for a few days, I haven't experimented with every aspect of its performance but I have taken enough pictures to begin to form some opinions and make some observations.1) The electronic viewfinder (EVF) is noticeably smaller than those on the B700 or P1000 but it gives a clear, crisp view of the images being framed. It also produces easily readable shooting parameter data and menus. The Diopter adjustment works well. The proximity sensor that automatically switches between the EVF and the LCD touch screen works as advertised but, until I got used to the placement of the sensor and EVF on the rear of the camera (left side vs centered), I found that I sometimes triggered the sensor with my left thumb during handling. NOTE: I've been using the viewfinder exclusively for shooting so I have no opinion on touch screen performance except to say that it's bright, clear and crisp when displaying menus and reviewing images.2) Zooming seems quick, smooth and accurate. Both zooming levers perform as they should as does the Snap Back button. NOTE: I've only used optical zoom because I've been capturing JPG and RAW data files in PSAM modes. When capturing RAW data files, digital zoom is disabled.3) So far, auto focusing seems quick with no hunting. The single exception I found was when I enabled Macro focusing for super close ups. I only tried a few shots, but on a couple of occasions, the camera struggled, hunting a bit before achieving a good focus.4) All the images I've shot so far were with the camera handheld using, with one exception, only PSAM modes - no tripod shots yet. The Vibration Reduction (VR) feature works great. I've only tried one Scene mode, Backlighting. For Backlighting, the camera takes a series of images and uses software in the camera to synthesize a single JPG image from the High Dynamic Range (HDR) images. It worked as it should.5) The protruding grip on the front of the camera is large enough to let one keep a firm grip but not so large as to compromise the camera's size. NOTE: I purchased a Case Logic DCB313 camera case into which the A1000 fits nicely.6) I see the A1000 mainly as a companion camera to the others I own but also as a primary device when zoom isn't that important and ease of carry comes to the fore.7) I compared images from the A1000 to those from the P1000 using similar subjects shot on different days. For each of the image pairs of the turtles and geese in the last six images, the first image is from the A1000 and the second from the P1000. The A1000 doesn't quite capture the very fine details that the P1000 does IMO. This doesn't surprise or disappoint me. I suspect that the relative size of their optics may account for this. That said, the images produced by the A1000 are great. NOTE: 99.999% of the images I've shot so far have been taken outdoors in sunlight. I've have no basis to comment yet about the A1000's low light performance.8) I haven't taken any video with A1000 so I have no basis to comment on that feature.Bottom Line: Based on just a few days of handling and shooting, I'm very pleased with the A1000.

I was waiting for Nikon to release the A1000 as it has the capability of shooting RAW images, and so far I am pleased with the camera.It’s important to note that point and shoot cameras with a long zoom like this, 24mm-840mm, usually have a small sensor, so you are not going to get the same results you get with a crop frame or full frame DSLR. That being said, you can get good results from this camera. All the photos posted here with this review were taken with the A1000 with very minor (or in some cases no) post processing.The A1000 has a number of modes – the standard P,S,A,M modes – as well as “Auto” and scene modes for more automatic operation. The vibration reduction is also very good on this camera, so you are able to zoom long distances and keep the ISO relatively low, or shoot indoor with low shutter speeds. The camera does have a pop-up flash if the subject is too dark, but no flash shoe. The camera also has a sensor so that when you bring it up to your eye to take a photo it activates the electronic viewfinder (EVF). The senor is sensitive so if you run your finger over it the image on the rear screen will be off and the electronic viewfinder will be activated. There is also a button to manually activate the EVF.Additionally, being a Nikon camera, the A1000 has great ergonomics and  feels more substantial than other point and shoot cameras I researched. It’s small enough to easily fit in a jacket pocket (or cargo shorts pocket) or purse, but not tiny so that I feel like it’s going break or I’m going to drop it. The rear screen folds out and down, for selfies, (or when you want to get down low for photos of kids and pets) and the camera connects pretty easily to Snapbridge, the Nikon app for transferring photos from your camera to your cell phone.The one negative for me is the battery charging door, which appears flimsy and looks like it will break after repeated usage. I suggest buying a separate charger and some spare batteries, so you can charge the batteries without using the camera. Battery life is on the low side (about 250 shots).Overall, I like this camera and can definitely recommend it, especially if you are looking for something with a lot of reach. There are 1 inch (sensor size) compact point and shoot cameras on the market, but they do not provide a zoom like the A1000. I would rate it 4.5 stars.

The camera would indicate the SD card was unreadable and unusable.  Fortunately, I never lost existing pictures (my computer could always read the SD card) and a reformat using the SD Association SD card format application would get the camera to recognize the SD card again.Other issues are with picture quality.  Colors are generally washed out.  Also, the autofocus distance sensor caused all kinds of problems in pictures (providing a glow in the center of many pictures).  This camera is in serious need of a major firmward update!

Although many of the boxes on the ""perfect"" vlogging design were checked, there were also some major issues such as the lack of continuous autofocus and some distortion on the 24mm lens (should not happen at this 35mm equivalent focal length). The lack of continuous autofocus is even more critical because of the shallow focusing plane offered by the large 1"" sensor. When you are out vlogging, you are likely going to point your camera at other locations besides just yourself which will require re-focusing. In other words, if you switch from selfie mode to scenery mode in the same shot, the latter will be out of focus (DOA). The other issue of the lens distortion should not even occur at 24mm. The point of getting this camera was to avoid the GoPro-like fisheye distortion that may not be suitable for all situations. All software lens correction does is digitally fiddle with the image until it's less noticeable, but to the ""trained"" eye, it makes the image even worse because you will add distortion elsewhere. The manufacturers need to get more input from real vloggers and not designers who likely guess the requirements and inevitably miss the mark. I really wanted to like this camera, but these issues were just too significant to overcome as a vlogging camera.

I have also always felt awkward vlogging with a big camera–– this one definitely makes that less of an issue. It's easy to add to your kit because of the small size, even on a grip. The flip screen is such a great option to have on a camera of this size. I also have to mention that the camera is waterproof and dust proof, for anyone with a more adventurous style of traveling/creating.  Overall this camera is a powerhouse and an excellent investment for anyone looking to add something new to their tool kit. I don't even know what could compete with it right now.

This camera is so small that you can fit 3 in your pocket and it’s both waterproof and shock proof. In Hawaii we are surrounded by the ocean and I’ve taken it in there several times already.  As some one who uses the a7riii as my primary camera body and who cares about resolution for large prints, I’m happy to know that I have a one inch sensor that produces beautiful photos. Probably one of my favorite features in the camera is the interval shooting. Sony has put the best features of the newest firmware update for the premium a7 and a9 lines. I can set up a time lapse on the RX0ii while I’m shooting with my main body and not have to worry about missing anything. Did I mention that this has eye-AF?! Some of Sony’s main competitors done even have an autofocus system like this in their flagship camera bodies. This camera seriously has all the best things we love about Sony in a really small profile. It’s a great tool to have in your bag I take it with me wherever I go.

That's where it ends.For an action-cam, it's too limited. Abysmal battery life on its own, and no way to extend the battery life while keeping it waterproof.

The ""Ctrl f/Smartphone"" function is disabled when set to 4K recording, and the only way to enable it is it drop it to FHD recording. But even if you get set it up for 4K recording, the camera will overheat and shut down after 20-25 minutes... just short of the battery giving out.The limited footage it produces is good. However, it's too limited for me. The waterproof bit is useless if I can't take it snorkeling for a couple of hours without risking salt-water ingress while swapping batteries. I can't set it up as a remote camera, because there's no way to start/stop recording without physically touching the camera - and I can't leave it recording, even with USB power, for extended periods of time, because it will overheat and shut down.But then, if I want a good camera for short 4K clips, I can just use my phone.

I was initially unhappy with it over the lack of a lens cover which costs $50 and isn't available. We finally bought another adapter and 2 lens covers for about $17 - Filter Adapter JJC Conversion Lens Ring Adapter Ring Mount 40.5mm Filter and 2 Pack JJC 40.5mm Front Lens Cap Cover with Deluxe Cap Keeper - they're not as good due to having to deal with a hanging lens cap, but work alright. Sooner or later the lens will be scratched without a cover.The default settings make very low quality photos, but once you figure out how to set them to the highest quality, the photos are quite good. The manual that you have to download is not very clear about the different options.It would be better if it came with an extra battery and external charger, as well as a case.I'm very pleased with the Microscopic functions. The automatically stacking microscopic functions appear to me to be better than a dedicated macro lens on a DSL. Sometimes you get extra antennae or legs, but I'm amazed at how easy it makes taking good photos of very small objects, even tiny insects that aren't still.It seems to get the focus and exposure right on almost every photo, and is very fast. It is very worthwhile reading the manual, because there are many ""hi-tech"" functions that are very useful and can save you lots of time.The lack of a larger zoom is frustrating, but not as bad as I expected. Battery life is excellent, and the GPS works well, even if a little slow to hook up at first.  I would have given it 4-5 stars if the lens cover was not such an issue, and for $450 there should be a case and extra battery with a charger.

Pictures are bright and performance in lowlight is very good.  Macro is exceptional and underwater photos are very strong (easily the best among other compact UW cameras).  Dynamic range is very good and shadows are often properly exposed (unlike most other UW cameras that consistently underexpose shadows).  Despite this camera having only 12 MP, it frequently provides cleaner and more detailed images than its 16 and 20 MP competitors.  The custom settings are awesome...everything from the ability to shoot raw, the ability to set and stick 1 second shake reduction timers, to the custom saturation/gradation/contrast/sharpness/nr settings, and much more.  White balance tends to be good especially in indoor/macro/uw settings.  Reds perform well with this camera.  Scenes modes (like beach mode) tend to work well.Weaknesses:Video stabilization is a bit below average but decent and low light videos are brighter than the competition.  This cameras is a low floor, high ceiling camera...you will need to learn how to use it to gets best benefits.  At times the produced jpgs are too saturated or undersaturated.  I find a good work around is program mode > i-enhance (low) with NR (low) which works well in most cases.  If you edit raw, you don't have to worry about that.  Blues and greens are a bit weak in distant landscape shots.Minor Quips:A wrist strap is included...good for divers, but for paddlers, skiers, and hikers a neck strap would have been preferred.  4x zoom is a bit below average compared to other UW compacts...but zoom quality isn't bad and you can always purchased a telephoto addon to double the range.  There is no 4k 60p (just 4k 30p or 1080 60p), but few competitors for this class of camera off this.  The battery door and tripod mount are located next to each other...so if you need to switch batteries, you'll also need to remove your quick release mount which is a bit annoying.TG-5 vs TG-6:On paper, the TG-6 hasn't improved much, but there are subtle but important improvements.  New internal filters have been added to reduce chromatic aberration and the purple orb issues.  White balance appears slightly improved in the TG-6 and images are much less like to be overexposed (an issues with the TG-5).  The LCD on the TG-6 is much approved which is very handy when doing things like exposure compensation.  Minimum shutter speed controls, super-macro video, and the ability to use microscope focus in aperture priority are significant changes as well.Purple Orb:All TG cameras (and many non-Olympus cameras) occasionally show a small purple orb in the middle of the image.  This is likely light reflecting off of the sensor onto an internal lens element.  No reviewer brings it up, but it does exist.  Honestly I wouldn't panic if you see this.  I've shot 1000's of TG-6 outdoor images and maybe only 1-2 show this.  It is more apt to show indoors and in macro situations.  But...it only appears in select contexts.  Usually if you have max zoom, have a dark subject at the very center, are using a high iso, and there is a strong off-axis light source (or flat surface nearby like a wall that reflects a lot of light).  The new LCD screen makes it easy to see the orb and react accordingly...use the flash (the flash cures this in my experience), zoom out, or recompose the camera so the very center isn't on something very dark.  While many TG-5 users complained of this, I believe this has been significantly reduced in the TG-6, but it will occasionally happen...it's normal!Accessories:The FD-1 is highly recommended for macro and acts as a lens hood to protect the lens.  Screen protectors are recommended too (a two pack for $7 is available if you search Amazon ""screen protectors olympus tough"".  An external charger and backup batteries are recommend.  Li92 are better quality...but Li90 are a significantly better value.  Search Amazon ""bm Batteries and Charger for Olympus Tough"" for a nice charger/battery pack combo.

I have several point-and-shoots as well as a Canon 50D and I kept running into the same situation:  I needed a pocket-sized camera that could handle sand, water, and everyday situations.  I have 2 small kids and those are the environments I'm in.I just put the Olympus T-6 through 3 times in the ocean, 3 times in the pool, and in the actual sand while building a sandcastle IN ONE DAY...I'm so so so impressed.  It's true, the lack of a manual is pretty dumb but the quick-start guide gave you what you need.  I would not have been able to figure out how to even open the battery compartment without that guide though so take your time!  Lastly, I had read another review that lamented the lack of a wall charger,which I assumed meant one of the cartridge case ones that plug in the wall.  This camera comes with a usb cord that plugs into the wall.  It's perfectly fine!  It was a TERRIFIC buy for me and I am so so so so excited to keep using it.

B07RCM7D36,R1MPVMZYKF0FLA,L. Brehmer,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE23VKJO67QMZJFTUNHFCUMX2LVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"July 21, 2019",3,Good overall camera with some minor drawbacks and some great special features,20,2,Verified Purchase,"Overall a good camera. I was initially unhappy with it over the lack of a lens cover which costs $50 and isn't available. We finally bought another adapter and 2 lens covers for about $17 - Filter Adapter JJC Conversion Lens Ring Adapter Ring Mount 40.5mm Filter and 2 Pack JJC 40.5mm Front Lens Cap Cover with Deluxe Cap Keeper - they're not as good due to having to deal with a hanging lens cap, but work alright. Sooner or later the lens will be scratched without a cover.The default settings make very low quality photos, but once you figure out how to set them to the highest quality, the photos are quite good. The manual that you have to download is not very clear about the different options.It would be better if it came with an extra battery and external charger, as well as a case.I'm very pleased with the Microscopic functions. The automatically stacking microscopic functions appear to me to be better than a dedicated macro lens on a DSL. Sometimes you get extra antennae or legs, but I'm amazed at how easy it makes taking good photos of very small objects, even tiny insects that aren't still.It seems to get the focus and exposure right on almost every photo, and is very fast. It is very worthwhile reading the manual, because there are many ""hi-tech"" functions that are very useful and can save you lots of time.The lack of a larger zoom is frustrating, but not as bad as I expected. Battery life is excellent, and the GPS works well, even if a little slow to hook up at first.  I would have given it 4-5 stars if the lens cover was not such an issue, and for $450 there should be a case and extra battery with a charger.

B07RCM7D36,R1UK3BU5IXKODX,Aaron Smith,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGEAKVXHFOJKTGGERKR3Y2SWD3WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"August 4, 2019",4,Likely the best rugged compact camera on the market,48,1,Verified Purchase,"Strengths:Takes good high quality images for a 12 MP compact.  Pictures are bright and performance in lowlight is very good.  Macro is exceptional and underwater photos are very strong (easily the best among other compact UW cameras).  Dynamic range is very good and shadows are often properly exposed (unlike most other UW cameras that consistently underexpose shadows).  Despite this camera having only 12 MP, it frequently provides cleaner and more detailed images than its 16 and 20 MP competitors.  The custom settings are awesome...everything from the ability to shoot raw, the ability to set and stick 1 second shake reduction timers, to the custom saturation/gradation/contrast/sharpness/nr settings, and much more.  White balance tends to be good especially in indoor/macro/uw settings.  Reds perform well with this camera.  Scenes modes (like beach mode) tend to work well.Weaknesses:Video stabilization is a bit below average but decent and low light videos are brighter than the competition.  This cameras is a low floor, high ceiling camera...you will need to learn how to use it to gets best benefits.  At times the produced jpgs are too saturated or undersaturated.  I find a good work around is program mode > i-enhance (low) with NR (low) which works well in most cases.  If you edit raw, you don't have to worry about that.  Blues and greens are a bit weak in distant landscape shots.Minor Quips:A wrist strap is included...good for divers, but for paddlers, skiers, and hikers a neck strap would have been preferred.  4x zoom is a bit below average compared to other UW compacts...but zoom quality isn't bad and you can always purchased a telephoto addon to double the range.  There is no 4k 60p (just 4k 30p or 1080 60p), but few competitors for this class of camera off this.  The battery door and tripod mount are located next to each other...so if you need to switch batteries, you'll also need to remove your quick release mount which is a bit annoying.TG-5 vs TG-6:On paper, the TG-6 hasn't improved much, but there are subtle but important improvements.  New internal filters have been added to reduce chromatic aberration and the purple orb issues.  White balance appears slightly improved in the TG-6 and images are much less like to be overexposed (an issues with the TG-5).  The LCD on the TG-6 is much approved which is very handy when doing things like exposure compensation.  Minimum shutter speed controls, super-macro video, and the ability to use microscope focus in aperture priority are significant changes as well.Purple Orb:All TG cameras (and many non-Olympus cameras) occasionally show a small purple orb in the middle of the image.

If you stay still after tapping onto your face, it takes a good 5 seconds on average to focus. I wanted to like this camera but find myself picking up my smartphone to record videos more reliably.

At least for video mode, the focus is really bad. It's very slow to focus and usually misses focus altogether. It was so bad, that while I really wanted to love this camera, I ended up having to return it. Unless Canon fixes the issue with a firmware update, I would say avoid this camera unless you do not plan on using it for video at all (since it seems quite good for stills).It's too bad because the external mic jack on this + the ability to shoot in 4K were huge selling points for me.

Video autofocus, when it works, is horrible! Even if the focus box is around the subject it’s probably not in focus. 4k is a waste of time - it over heats in about 2-3mins. The 1080/30 looks ok, but (in my opinion) 25 fps in PAL mode looks much better (...completely baffled as to why Canon would drop 24 fps from their recent cameras...). It’s like Canon released a beta version of this camera instead of the finished product. I’ve had the Mark ii for several years, it’s still a great camera, and performs significantly better than the Mark iii.

Obviously there are better cameras but this is just perfect for what I need right now. The only thing I don't like about it is the way it keeps changing focus when I record video but other than that it's great.

As yet, we have not had an opportunity to use the camera, but we are sure it will be fine. The one thing with this camera, the owner is required to remove the memory card to transfer pictures, also have to recharge the battery but placing the battery into a pludgin. Their previous model all you had to do was plug the camera into a USB port on our laptop and both functions were accomplished at the same time. Just different I guess.
